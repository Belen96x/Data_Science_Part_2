Neuves-Maisons (French pronunciation: [nœv mɛzɔ̃], literally New Houses) is a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in North-Eastern France, on the banks of the Moselle.
The city had a great steel industry during the 19th and 20th century.
Neuves-Maisons erected a plaque in the memory of Émilie Busquant, a feminist, anarcho-syndicalist and an anti-colonial activist born in the area, on the fiftieth anniversary of her death in 2003. A 2015 documentary by director Rabah Zanoun introduced a French audience to her forgotten story.
