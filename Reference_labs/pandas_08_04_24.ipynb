These vehicles will usually be equipped with larger luggage space, and incorporate special branding. They are also commonly (but not always) painted with bright colours to stand out among other airport vehicles and to be easily seen by the crews of taxiing aircraft when negotiating the aprons.\\nAirport buses have been in use since the 1960s, when nationalised operator British European Airways employed the archetypal London red AEC Routemaster buses in a blue and white livery with luggage trailers on service to Heathrow Airport.\\n\\n\\n== On airport transfer ==\\nBus transport within an airport may take the following forms, and be operated by the airport owner, an airline, or a contractor to either.\\n\\n\\n=== Airside transfer ===\\n\\nIn the cases where airports do not use a jet bridge, has too few of them, for long distance transfers or for reasons of safety, passengers will be transferred from the airport terminal arrival or departure gate to the aircraft using an airside transfer bus or apron bus.\\nAirside transfer buses can be of normal bus design, or due to not running on the public highway, can be extra long and wide, to hold the maximum number of passengers. Sometimes a trailer bus is employed. Transfer buses are usually fitted with minimal or no seating, with passengers standing for the journey. Sometimes for larger aircraft a coach is used to ferry customers to or from the terminal as coaches hold more people. Transfer buses will usually be fitted with flashing beacons for operating airside near runways. They may also feature driving cabs at both ends.\\nWashington Dulles airport uses mobile lounges with a liftable passenger cabin for airside transfer; they work as a combination of an airside bus and a jet bridge.\\n\\n\\n=== Terminal transfer ===\\n\\nIn cases where the airport features multiple terminals which are far apart or not physically connected, and where there exists no people mover or other transfer alternative, a zero-fare transfer bus may be employed to transfer connecting passengers from one terminal to another. Terminal transfer may also be incorporated into public transport bus networks.\\n\\n\\n=== Car park transfer ===\\n\\nIn cases where the airport owned or affiliated car parks are large or relatively far from the terminal building, the airport owner or contractor may provide free car park shuttle buses making circular or shuttle runs between terminals and car park bus stands.\\n\\n\\n== Off airport transfer ==\\nThird-party companies offering services to airline passengers may also operate buses as part of their business, with pick-up and drop off points near the airport terminal, and extra luggage space. These usually comprise:\\n\\nOff airport car parking services. These car park providers provide cheap car-parking some distance from the airport, by transferring passengers in shuttle buses. These can be anywhere from luxury coaches, full size buses or minibuses, sometimes fitted with luggage trailers.\\nCar rental companies. Often, car rental providers will have their vehicles stored off-site, and transfer customers in regular buses.\\nAirport hotels will often offer a complimentary airport bus service, to entice guests to stay at their property.\\n\\n\\n== Public bus services ==\\nSeveral public transport operations may include airport focused services, such as:\\n\\n\\n=== Intermodal shuttle buses ===\\n\\nSome transport companies may provide shuttle buses between railway stations and airports, with transit buses fitted for extra luggage space. These are sometimes supported financially by the airport or railway company. In England, Durham Tees Valley Airport contracted Arriva North East bus company to provide a free shuttle bus for airport passengers, and railway operator Govia Thameslink Railway operates a fare paying shuttle bus from Luton Airport Parkway railway station to Luton Airport.In addition, some airlines run bus services from a city's bus terminal to an airport or, in other cases, connecting two airports whose cities' population sizes are deemed too small for them to have air service between each other. One example of the former is Singapore Airlines' bus service from downtown Newark, New Jersey to Newark Liberty International Airport. An example of the latter is United Airlines service from Beaumont Airport in Beaumont, Texas to Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, which used to be done on United Express SAAB 340 aircraft but which is now run on a bus.\\n\\n\\n=== Premium airlink services ===\\n\\nBus companies that operate normal transit bus services may often operate a premium fare route to an airport alongside their standard routes, using specially branded vehicles with extra luggage space. These routes are usually limited stop, rather than point to point shuttle buses.\\nNewly privatised London Buses operated an Airbus service from Victoria Coach Station to Heathrow Airport in the 1990s, although this was withdrawn after London Underground and Heathrow Express rail links were improved.\\n\\n\\n=== Demand responsive shuttle buses ===\\nSome public bus operators have moved into the demand responsive transport sector, bridging the gap between premium fixed route bus services and private hire airport taxicabs, incorporating an area in which the service can vary its route to pick up pre-booked passengers. Unlike private hire firms, these are still legally public buses. Examples include Dot2Dot from National Express, and the Edinburgh Shuttle operated by Lothian Buses, which feature high specification minibus based vehicles with luggage space.\\n\\n\\n=== Express services ===\\n\\nSeveral long-distance express bus and coach operators make airports hubs of their service networks, such as National Express Coaches Airport services. These services do not necessarily use vehicles that have any extra modification beyond the standard express bus or coach specification, although they will usually carry a livery indicating the airport service, and special route numbers such as 747.\\nA specialist express bus operation is that of the likes of easyBus, that runs minibus services from stops in London direct to Luton Airport.\\n\\n\\n=== Terminal transfer ===\\nIn the case where different airport terminals are far apart and not linked by other modes, public bus operators may choose to provide a route to link the two terminals, either as a point to point shuttle or as part of a standard route network. A specialist example being the Fastway, which is a bus rapid transit scheme which at the heart of its route network links the north and south terminals of Gatwick Airport.\\n\\n\\n=== Railair ===\\n\\nRailAir, or Railair, services are designed to connect railway stations to airports, where there is no direct train link.\\n\\n\\n== Other non-airport bus services ==\\n\\n\\n=== Standard bus services ===\\nIn addition to the specially equipped or liveried buses that help airports, several non-specific bus services may also stop or terminate at airports. These are often scheduled outside normal operating hours to serve the airport workers and passengers with unsociable flight times as well as normal passengers.\\n\\n\\n=== Private hire ===\\nSeveral private hire airport transfer companies, or airport focused taxicab operators, also use minibuses or minivans, to varying specifications, for transporting groups of people.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nLimousine\\nList of buses\\nMobile lounge\\nPeople mover\\nShuttle bus\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to Airport buses at Wikimedia Commons\\n\"], ['Airport_check-in', 'Airports', 'Airport check-in is the process whereby passengers are accepted by an airline at the airport prior to travel.  The airlines typically use service counters found at airports. The check-in is normally handled by an airline itself or a handling agent working on behalf of an airline. Passengers usually hand over any baggage that they do not wish or are not allowed to carry in to the aircraft\\'s cabin and receive a boarding pass before they can proceed to board their aircraft.\\nCheck-in is usually the first procedure for a passenger when arriving at an airport, as airline regulations require passengers to check in by certain times prior to the departure of a flight. This duration spans from 15 minutes to 2 hours depending on the destination and airline (with self check in, this can be expanded to 24 hours, if checking in by online processes).  During this process, the passenger has the ability to ask for special accommodations such as seating preferences, inquire about flight or destination information, accumulate frequent flyer program miles, or pay for upgrades. The required time is sometimes written in the reservation, sometimes written somewhere in websites, and sometimes only referred as \"passengers should allow sufficient time for check-in\". \\nThe airline check-in\\'s main function, however, is to accept luggage that is to go in the aircraft\\'s cargo hold and issue boarding passes.\\nIn-town check-in service is a service offered by some cities such as Abu Dhabi, Seoul, Hong Kong, Delhi, Kuala Lumpur–International, Stockholm, Vienna, Toronto and Taipei, where passengers may check in luggage in designated places within the city but outside the airport. This reduces check-in time and queuing at the airport.\\n\\n\\n== Types of check-in ==\\n\\n\\n=== Destination or Point Check-in ===\\nIf passenger is checked in for only one sector of the flight, then it is called destination or point check-in.\\n\\n\\n=== Through Check-in ===\\nIf a passenger is checked on all the onward flights and has boarding passes for all the connecting flights and bags are also through checked i.e. passenger does not need to recheck him/herself and the baggage again on the transit, then the check-in is known as through check-in.\\n\\n\\n== Passenger identity registration ==\\n\\nAt the time of check-in, one of the agent\\'s primary duties is to check for valid documents. This includes tickets, passports, visas, letters of consent, and in some cases, passengers\\' address and contact details to comply with immigration requirements.\\nSome airlines may ask passengers to present the original credit card used for payment.\\n\\n\\n== Baggage registration ==\\nAt the time of check-in, the passenger hands over baggage which is checked by the airport security and may be sealed (subject to the security regulations in that country). Anything that is above the weight limit or which is not allowed to be carried by the passenger themselves in the aircraft cabin is usually handed over to the agent at the time of check-in. The baggage allowance, if any, is prescribed by the airline and anything in excess will warrant additional surcharges. \\n\\n\\n=== Self-service bag drop ===\\n\\nSome airlines have a self-check-in process allowing passengers with bags to check-in at Self Bag Drop machines. Passengers then attach the baggage tag and drop the bag at the baggage drop belt.  Passengers without checked luggage can go straight to the lounge (if entitled to lounge access) and check in at the kiosk there using their ePass (a small RFID device only for its premium customers) or proceed straight to the departure gate.  Many airlines use electronic check-in such as ePass, mPass, or similar mobile apps, and these applications serve as the boarding pass.\\n\\n\\n== Seating assignment ==\\nUsually at the time of check-in, an option of selecting a specific seat is offered, with passengers asked if they prefer a window or an aisle seat.\\n\\n\\n== Online check-in ==\\nOnline check-in is the process in which passengers confirm their presence on a flight via the Internet and typically print their own boarding passes. Depending on the carrier and the specific flight, passengers may also enter details such as meal options and baggage quantities and select their preferred seating.\\nThis service is generally promoted by the airlines to passengers as being easier and faster because it reduces the time a passenger would normally spend at an airport check-in counter. Some airlines, however, would still require passengers to proceed to a check-in counter at the airport, regardless of preferred check-in method, for document verification (e.g., to travel to countries where a visa is required, or to ensure the credit card used to purchase is genuine and/or matches the identity of the person who made the purchase). If passengers need to continue the check-in process at the airport after performing an online check-in, a special lane is typically offered to them to reduce wait times unless all desks are designated as baggage drop-off points. Furthermore, online check-in for a flight is often available earlier than its in-person counterpart. The process then transfers to passengers\\' control over their check-in. Airlines may use the system because self-service is frequently more efficient to operate, with a greater ability to cope with surges in passenger numbers. It also lessens activity at the airport, saving airlines money and reducing passenger waiting times.\\nRyanair charges passengers a fee which can amount to 60 Euros for not using online check-in, except in certain limited circumstances. Furthermore, by the start of 2010, all passengers were required to check in online, therefore abolishing the use of check-in desks. Despite this, passengers are still charged to print their boarding cards out.\\nOnline check-in is increasingly becoming required in other legacy carriers, particularly in Europe as the airport check-in desks are being relegated as baggage drop points only.\\nAlaska Airlines was the first to offer online check-in. The system was first offered on a limited basis starting in the second quarter of 1999, and was available to the general public on selected flights the following quarter. Since then, a growing number of airlines have introduced the system.\\nBritish Airways were the first airline to deploy online check-in globally having sealed approval from both the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority and FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) for use of the 3-D Barcode technology. Typically, web-based check-in for airline travel is offered on the airline\\'s website not earlier than 24 hours before a flight\\'s scheduled departure or seven days for Internet Check-In Assistant. However, some airlines allow a longer time, such as easyJet, which opens it 30 days beforehand. Depending on the airline, there can be benefits of better seating or upgrades to first class or business class offered to the first people to check in for a flight. In order to meet this demand, some sites have offered travelers the ability to request an airline check-in prior to the 24-hour window and receive airline boarding passes by email when available from the airline. Some airlines charge for the privilege of early check-in before the 24-hour window opens, thus capitalising on the demand for desirable seats such as those immediately behind a bulkhead or emergency exit row, such as Ryanair, which allow check-in up to 60 days before the flight for passengers who pay for a seat reservation. \\n\\n\\n=== Mobile check-in ===\\nIn the mid-late 2000s, checking in was made possible using a passenger\\'s mobile phone or PDA. A GPRS or 3G-capable smartphone or an internet-capable PDA is required in most instances (Finnair allows check-in by text message), and the check-in feature may be accessed by keying in a website on the mobile phone\\'s browser or by downloading a dedicated application. The process is then similar to that which one would expect when checking in using a personal computer.\\nAt the end of the mobile check-in process, some airlines send a mobile boarding pass to a passenger\\'s mobile device, which can be scanned at the airport during security checks and boarding. However, others send an electronic confirmation with a barcode that can be presented to the staff at check-in or scanned at the kiosks to continue the check-in process (i.e., to have boarding passes issued).\\nOne disadvantage of early check-in is that it puts a restriction on a person\\'s agent changing their flight. As the ticket coupon has to be \"opened\" again prior to any changes being made, this may take some time to arrange.\\n\\n\\n== Premium check-in and lounge access ==\\nIf the passenger carries a first or business class ticket or presents a certain frequent flyer program membership card (usually the higher-level tiers), or any other arrangements with the carrier, access to the premium check-in area and/or the lounge may be offered.\\nPremium check-in areas vary among airlines and airports. The main airport in which an airline hub is located normally offers a more thorough and exclusive premium check-in experience, normally inside a separate check-in lounge. For example, Air New Zealand\\'s Auckland International premium check-in lounge provides a dedicated customs clearance counter and direct shortcut access to the security checkpoints. Airlines operating in minor airports generally offer an exclusive and separate premium check-in queue lane, often combined for its first, business, and/or premium economy passengers.\\nSingapore Airlines also offers this service to First Class and Suites passengers, whose flights depart Singapore Changi Airport\\'s Terminal 3. These passengers have a dedicated curb side entrance and can wait at couches while staff assist them in checking-in. They are then led to a dedicated passport control counter.\\nEmirates provides its first-class/business-class customers with individual and separate check-in lane at its hub DXB, to divide most economy-class customers from main check-in lobby apart, and then ensuring those first-class/business-class customers\\' privacy.SkyTeam provides the priority check-in service \"SkyPriority\", whose members could access the check-in counter to authorize the prioritized check-in service, along with the larger luggage capacity.\\n\\n\\n== In-town check-in ==\\n\\nIn some cities (including Bangkok, Dubai, Sharjah, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, New Delhi, Chennai, Seoul, Vienna and Taipei), certain airlines provide in-town check-in services, allowing passengers to check their luggage at check-in counters located in railway or subway terminals as much as a day ahead of time. This service allows passengers to take a train to the airport without the burden of carrying their luggage to the airport terminal. In Seoul, for example, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and Jeju Air offer check-in services at Seoul Station. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Airlines and Cathay Pacific offer in-town check-in at KL Sentral. In Taipei, China Airlines and EVA Air offer in-town check-in at Taipei Main Station.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n'], ['Airport_security', 'Airports', 'Airport security refers to the techniques and methods used in an attempt to protect passengers, staff, aircraft, and airport property from accidental/malicious harm, crime, terrorism, and other threats.\\nAviation security is a combination of measures and human and material resources in order to safeguard civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference. Unlawful interference could be acts of terrorism, sabotage, threat to life and property, communication of false threat, bombing, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Description ==\\nLarge numbers of people pass through airports every day. This presents potential targets for terrorism and other forms of crime because of the number of people located in one place. Similarly, the high concentration of people on large airliners increases the potentially high death rate with attacks on aircraft, and the ability to use a hijacked airplane as a lethal weapon may provide an alluring target for terrorism (such as during the September 11 attacks).\\n\\nAirport security attempts to prevent any threats or potentially dangerous situations from arising or entering the country. If airport security does succeed then the chances of any dangerous situation, illegal items or threats entering into an aircraft, country or airport are greatly reduced. As such, airport security serves several purposes: To protect the airport and country from any threatening events, to reassure the traveling public that they are safe and to protect the country and their people.Monte R. Belger of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration notes \"The goal of aviation security is to prevent harm to aircraft, passengers, and crew, as well as support national security and counter-terrorism policy.\"\\n\\n\\n== Airport enforcement authority ==\\n\\nWhile some countries may have an agency that protects all of their airports (such as Australia, in which the Australian Federal Police polices the airport), in other countries the protection is controlled at the state or local level. The primary personnel will vary and can include:\\n\\nA police force hired and dedicated to the airport e.g. the Irish Airport Police Service\\nA branch (substation) of the local police department stationed at the airport\\nMembers of the local police department assigned to the airport as their normal patrol area\\nMembers of a country\\'s airport protection service\\nPolice dog services for explosive detection, drug detection and other purposesOther resources may include:\\n\\nSecurity guards\\nParamilitary forces\\nMilitary forces\\n\\n\\n== Process and equipment ==\\n\\nSome incidents have been the result of travelers carrying either weapons or items that could be used as weapons on board aircraft so that they can hijack the plane. Travelers are screened by metal detectors and/or millimeter wave scanners. Explosive detection machines used include X-ray machines and explosives trace-detection portal machines (a.k.a. \"puffer machines\"). In some cases, detection of explosives can be automated using machine learning techniques. In the United States, the TSA is working on new scanning machines that are still effective searching for objects that are not allowed in the airplanes but that do not depict the passengers in a state of undress that some find embarrassing. Explosive detection machines can also be used for both carry-on and checked baggage. These detect volatile compounds given off from explosives using gas chromatography.Computed tomography and walk-through body scanning (Thz radiation) may also be done. Artificial intelligence systems are also being used, for example for translation service on information stations around the airport and for reducing the time airplanes spend at the gate between flights (by monitoring and analyzing everything that happens after the aircraft lands). In the future, it may also be used in conjunction with CT machines and Thz radiation detectors. It may also be used for use with biometric deployment across touchpoints and of new solutions, such as risk-based screening and intelligent video analytics.A recent development is the controversial use of backscatter X-rays to detect hidden weapons and explosives on passengers. These devices, which use Compton scattering, require that the passenger stand close to a flat panel and produce a high resolution image.  A technology released in Israel in early 2008 allows passengers to pass through metal detectors without removing their shoes, a process required as walk-through gate detectors are not reliable in detecting metal in shoes or on the lower body extremities. Alternately, the passengers step fully shoed onto a device which scans in under 1.2 seconds for objects as small as a razor blade.\\nIn some countries, specially trained individuals may engage passengers in a conversation to detect threats rather than solely relying on equipment to find threats.A single backscatter scan exposes the target to between 0.05 and 0.1 microsievert of radiation. In comparison, the exposure from a standard chest x-ray is almost 100 times higher.Generally people are screened through airport security into areas where the exit gates to the aircraft are located. These areas are often called \"secure\", \"sterile\" and airside. Passengers are discharged from airliners into the sterile area so that they usually will not have to be re-screened if disembarking from a domestic flight; however they are still subject to search at any time. Airport food outlets have started using plastic glasses and utensils as opposed to glasses made out of glass and utensils made out of metal to reduce the usefulness of such items as weapons.In the United States non-passengers were once allowed on the concourses to meet arriving friends or relatives at their gates, but this is now greatly restricted due to the terrorist attacks. Non-passengers must obtain a gate pass to enter the secure area of the airport. The most common reasons that a non-passenger may obtain a gate pass is to assist children and the elderly as well as for attending business meetings that take place in the secure area of the airport. In the United States, at least 24 hours notice is generally required for those planning to attend a business meeting inside the secure area of the airport. Other countries, such as Australia do not restrict non-travellers from accessing the airside area, however non-travellers are typically subject to the same security scans as travellers.Sensitive areas in airports, including airport ramps and operational spaces, are restricted from the general public. Called a SIDA (Security Identification Display Area), these spaces require special qualifications to enter. Systems can consist of physical access control gates or more passive systems that monitor people moving through restricted areas and sound an alert if a restricted area is entered.Throughout the world, there have been a few dozen airports that have instituted a version of a \"trusted traveler program\". Proponents argue that security screening can be made more efficient by detecting those people who are threats and then searching them. They argue that searching trusted, verified individuals should not take the amount of time it does. Critics argue that such programs decrease security by providing an easier path to carry contraband through.Another critical security measure used by several regional and international airports is that of fiber optic perimeter intrusion detection systems. These security systems allow airport security to locate and detect any intrusion on the airport perimeter, ensuring real-time, immediate intrusion notification that allows security personnel to assess the threat and track movement and engage necessary security procedures. This has notably been utilised at Dulles International Airport and U.S. Military JFPASS.\\n\\n\\n== Notable incidents ==\\nThe world\\'s first terrorist attack while in flight was Cubana Flight 455 on October 6, 1976, when the airliner flying from Barbados to Jamaica was brought down by two time bombs, killing 73 people. Evidence implicated several Central Intelligence Agency-linked anti-Castro Cuban exiles and members of the Venezuelan secret police DISIP, including Luis Posada Carriles.The single deadliest airline catastrophe resulting from the failure of airport security to detect an onboard bomb was Air India Flight 182 in 1985, which killed 329 people.\\nAnother onboard bomb that slipped through airport security was the one on Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, which killed 270 people; 259 on the plane, and 11 residents of Lockerbie, Scotland.\\nAnother notable failure was the 1994 bombing of Philippine Airlines Flight 434, which turned out to be a test run for a planned terrorist attack called Operation Bojinka. The explosion was small, killing one person, and the plane made an emergency landing. Operation Bojinka was discovered and foiled by Manila police in 1995.\\nOn May 30, 1972, three members of the Japanese Red Army undertook a terrorist attack, popularly called the Lod Airport massacre, at the Lod Airport, now known as the Ben Gurion International Airport, in Tel Aviv. Firing indiscriminately with automatic firearms and throwing grenades, they managed to kill 24 people and injure 78 others before being neutralized (one of them through suicide). One of the three terrorists, Kozo Okamoto, survived the incident.\\nThe Rome and Vienna airport attacks in December 1985 were two more instances of airport security failures. The attacks left 20 people dead when gunmen threw grenades and opened fire on travelers at El Al airline ticket counters.\\nThe September 11 attacks are the most widely recognized terrorist attacks in recent times involving air travel. On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 members of the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda took control of four airplanes on the east coast of the United States and deliberately crashed two into both World Trade Center towers in New York City and the third into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. A fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, not reaching Washington, D.C., for its intended target, either the U.S. Capitol or the White House. The attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people, including the 245 civilians, a law enforcement officer, and the 19 hijackers on board the four airplanes.\\nOn July 5, 2002, a gunman opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport (Israel\\'s El Al Ticket Counter). The shooter killed two people and injured four.\\nOn August 10, 2006, security at airports in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States was raised significantly due to the uncovering by British authorities of a terror plot aimed at detonating liquid explosives on flights originating from these countries. This is also notable as it was the first time the U.S. Terror Alert Level ever reached \"red\". The incident also led to tighter restrictions on carrying liquids and gels in hand luggage in the EU, Canada, and the United States.On May 7, 2020, Southwest Airlines Flight 1392 struck and killed a pedestrian while landing on runway 17R at Austin–Bergstrom International Airport. No injuries were reported to the 53 passengers and 5 crew aboard the aircraft. The victim, who was not a badged airport employee, was subsequently confirmed to have breached airport security in reaching the runway. The accident is under investigation.\\n\\n\\n== Airport security by country/region ==\\n\\n\\n=== Canada ===\\nAll restrictions involving airport security are determined by Transport Canada and some are implemented by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) in conjunction with the Airport Operator . Since the September 11 attacks, as well as the Air India bombing in 1985 and other incidents, airport security has tightened in Canada in order to prevent any attacks in Canadian Airspace.\\nCATSA uses x-ray machines to verify the contents of all carry-ons as well as metal detectors, explosive trace detection (ETD) equipment and random physical searches of passengers at the pre-board screening points. X-ray machines, CTX machines, high-resolution x-rays and ETDs are also used to scan checked bags. All checked baggage is always x-rayed at all major commercial airports.\\nCATSA launched its Restricted Area Identity Card (RAIC) program in January 2007. RAIC is the world\\'s first dual biometric access control system for airports. This program replaces the old Airport Restricted Area Passes issued to airport employees after security checks by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Transport Canada with new cards (issued after the same checks are conducted) that contain biometric information (fingerprints and iris scans) belonging to the person issued the RAIC.\\nWhile CATSA is responsible for pre-board passenger and random non-passenger screening, they contract out to third-party \"service providers\" such as G4S, Securitas and GardaWorld to train, manage and employ the screening officers. In addition, individual airport authorities which were privatized in the 1990s by the Canadian Government are responsible for general airport security rather than CATSA and normally contract out to private companies and in the case of large airports, pay for a small contingent of local police officers to remain on site as well.\\nSafety and security at Canada\\'s airports are provided by local police forces. The RCMP once used to provide this service at most airports, but remains so only for a few today:\\n\\nVancouver International Airport — RCMP Richmond detachment\\nCalgary International Airport — Calgary Police Service Airport Unit (1997)\\nEdmonton International Airport — RCMP Edmonton International Airport detachment\\nWinnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport — Winnipeg Police Service (1997)\\nToronto Pearson International Airport — Peel Regional Police Airport Division (1997) with assistance from the RCMP Toronto Airport detachment\\nOttawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport — Ottawa Police Service Airport Policing Section (1997)\\nMontréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport — Airport Unit of the Montreal Police Service with assistance from the RCMP Airport Unit\\nHalifax Stanfield International Airport — Halifax Regional Police\\n\\n\\n=== European Union ===\\n\\nRegulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes common rules in the European Union to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference. The regulation\\'s provisions apply to all airports or parts of airports located in an EU country that are not used exclusively for military purposes. The provisions also apply to all operators, including air carriers, providing services at the aforementioned airports. It also applies to all entities located inside or outside airport premises providing services to airports.\\nThe standards of regulation 300/2008 are implemented by Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1998.The regulation no 2320/2002 from 2002 introduced the requirement to have security checks for all passenger flights, also domestic. Some EU countries had no checks for domestic flights until around 2005 (introducing full security checks took some time since terminals might need expansion).\\n\\n\\n==== Finland ====\\nPassenger, luggage and freight security checking and security guard duties are outsourced to contractors. General public security is the responsibility of the Finnish Police, which has an airport unit at Helsinki Airport. The airport unit has a criminal investigation, a canine and a TEPO (terrorist and bomb) squad, and a PTR (police, customs and border guard) intelligence component. Furthermore, units of the Finnish Border Guard units at airports often arrest wanted individuals or fugitives at the border, and the Finnish Customs seizes e.g. weapons, false documents or explosives in addition to wanted individuals.\\n\\n\\n==== France ====\\nFrench security has been stepped up since terrorist attacks in France in 1986. In response France established the Vigipirate program. The program uses troops to reinforce local security and increases requirements in screenings and ID checks. Since 1996 security check-points have transferred from the Police Nationale/Gendarmerie de l\\'Air to private companies hired by the airport authorities.\\n\\n\\n==== Iceland ====\\nAs a member of the European Economic Area, Iceland has adopted EC regulation No 300/2008 into national law and thus complies with EU standards on airport security for all international flights. Domestic flights within Icelandic territory are however exempted from the security rules. The exemption was granted by the EEA Joint Committee citing the geographical remoteness of the country as well as its low population density and small size of aircraft used in domestic operations.\\n\\n\\n==== Netherlands ====\\nAirport security in the Netherlands is provided by the Koninklijke Marechaussee, Royal Military Constabulary. In addition to the Royal Military Constabulary, security services in and around airports in the Netherlands are provided by multiple  Private security companies. \\n\\n\\n==== Spain ====\\nAirport security in Spain is provided by police forces, as well as private security guards. The Policía Nacional provides general security as well as passport (in international airports) and documentation checking. In Catalonia and Basque Country, the Mossos d\\'Esquadra and the Ertzaintza, respectively, have replaced the Policía Nacional except for documentation functions. The Guardia Civil handles the security and customs checking, often aided by private security guards. Local police provide security and traffic control outside the airport building.\\nSecurity measures are controlled by the state-owned company Aena, and are bound to European Commission Regulations, as in other European Union countries.\\n\\n\\n==== Sweden ====\\nAirport security is handled by security guards provided by the airport itself, with police assistance if needed. Airport fire fighters are also security guards.  The Swedish Transport Agency decides the rules for the check, based on international regulations. Airports are generally defined by law as \"protected objects\", which give guards extra authority, like demanding identity documents and search people\\'s belongings. Sweden has traditionally seen itself as a low-crime country with little need for security checks. Sweden introduced security checks for international departures when international regulations demanded that around the 1970s/1980s. In September 2001, there was a decision to introduce security checks also for domestic flights. This took a few years to implement as domestic airports and terminals were not prepared with room for this.\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\n\\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) is the governing authority for airport security in the United Kingdom, with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also responsible for certain security regulatory functions. In September 2004, with the Home Office, DfT started an initiative called the \"Multi Agency Threat and Risk Assessment\" (MATRA), which was piloted at five of the United Kingdom\\'s major airports — Heathrow, Birmingham, East Midlands Airport, Newcastle and Glasgow. Following successful trials, the scheme has now been rolled out across all 44 airports.\\nSince the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, the United Kingdom has been assessed as a high risk country due to its support of the United States both in its invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.\\nFrom January 7, 2008, travelers are no longer limited to a single piece of carry-on luggage at most of the UK\\'s major airports. Currently, hand luggage is not limited by size or weight by the DfT/CAA, although most airlines do impose their own rules.\\nThe UK trialed a controversial new method of screening passengers to further improve airport security using backscatter X-ray machines that provide a 360-degree view of a person, as well as \"see\" under clothes, right down to the skin and bones. They are no longer used and were replaced by millimeter wave scanners which shows any hidden items while not showing the body of the passenger.\\n\\n\\n=== Hong Kong ===\\n\\nThe Hong Kong International Airport is secured by the Hong Kong Police Force and Aviation Security Company (AVSECO). Within the police force, the Airport District is responsible for the safety and security of the airport region. Airport Security Units are deployed around the airport and are armed with H&K MP5 A3 sub-machine guns and Glock 17 pistols. The security of the restricted area is the responsibility of the police and AVSECO.\\nWhile the airport is under the control of the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), the security power has been delegated to the AVSECO staffs. All persons and baggages carried by them must be X-Rayed and checked at the security screening points of the AVSECO (with a few exceptions at the Tenant Restricted Area).\\nThe Immigration Department will check incomers passport and other identities, while the Customs and Excise Department will check passengers and crews\\' luggage to discourage smuggling of drugs and contraband from entering Hong Kong.\\n\\n\\n=== India ===\\nIndia stepped up its airport security after the 1999 Kandahar hijacking. The Central Industrial Security Force, a paramilitary organisation, is in charge of airport security under the regulatory framework of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (Ministry of Civil Aviation). CISF formed an Airport Security Group to protect Indian airports. Every airport has now been given an APSU (Airport Security Unit), a trained unit to counter unlawful interference with civil aviation. Apart from the CISF, every domestic airline has a security group who looks after the aircraft security.\\nTerrorist threats and narcotics are the main threats in Indian airports. Another problem that some airports face is the proliferation of slums around the airport boundaries in places like Mumbai. Before boarding, additional searching of hand luggage is likely. Moreover, other than this, the CISF has many other duties in context of aviation security. The cargo security and screening is done by the Regulated Agents or airlines\\' and airports\\' own security staff who are tested and certified by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), an aviation security regulator.\\n\\n\\n=== Israel ===\\nEl Al Airlines is headquartered in Israel. The last hijacking occurred on July 23, 1968, and no plane departing Ben Gurion Airport, just outside Tel Aviv, has ever been hijacked.It was in 1972 that terrorists from the Japanese Red Army launched an attack that led to the deaths of at least 24 people at Lod Airport. Since then, security at the airport relies on a number of fundamentals, including a heavy focus on what Raphael Ron, former director of security at Ben Gurion Airport, terms the \"human factor\", which may be generalized as \"the inescapable fact that terrorist attacks are carried out by people who can be found and stopped by an effective security methodology.\"On December 27, 1985, terrorists simultaneously attacked El Al ticket counters at the Rome, Italy and Vienna, Austria airports using machine guns and hand grenades. Nineteen civilians were killed and many wounded. In response, Israel developed further methods to stop such massacres and drastically improved security measures around Israeli airports and even promised to provide plainclothes armed guards at each foreign airport. The last successful airline-related terrorist attack was in 1986, when a security agent found a suitcase full of explosives during the initial screening process. While the bag did not make it on board, it did injure 13 after detonating in the terminal.As part of its focus on this so-called \"human factor,\" Israeli security officers interrogate travelers using racial profiling, singling out those who appear to be Arab based on name or physical appearance. Additionally, all passengers, even those who do not appear to be of Arab descent, are questioned as to why they are traveling to Israel, followed by several general questions about the trip in order to search for inconsistencies. Although numerous civil rights groups have demanded an end to the profiling, Israel maintains that it is both effective and unavoidable. According to Ariel Merari, an Israeli terrorism expert, \"it would be foolish not to use profiling when everyone knows that most terrorists come from certain ethnic groups. They are likely to be Muslim and young, and the potential threat justifies inconveniencing a certain ethnic group.Passengers leaving Israel are checked against a computerized list. The computers, maintained by the Israeli Ministry of Interior, are connected to the Israeli police, FBI, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Scotland Yard, Shin Bet, and Interpol in order to catch suspects or others leaving the country illegally.Despite such tight security, an incident occurred on November 17, 2002, in which a man apparently slipped through airport security at Ben Gurion Airport with a pocketknife and attempted to storm the cockpit of El Al Flight 581 en route from Tel Aviv to Istanbul, Turkey. While no injuries were reported and the attacker was subdued by guards hidden among the passengers 15 minutes before the plane landed safely in Turkey, authorities did shut down Ben Gurion for some time after the attack to reassess the security situation and an investigation was opened to determine how the man, an Israeli Arab, managed to smuggle the knife past the airport security.At a conference in May 2008, the United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told Reuters interviewers that the United States will seek to adopt some of the Israeli security measures at domestic airports. He left his post in January 2009, a mere 6 months after this statement, which may or may not have been enough time to implement them.On a more limited focus, American airports have been turning to the Israeli government and Israeli-run firms to help upgrade security in the post-9/11 world. Israeli officials toured Los Angeles Airport in November 2008 to re-evaluate the airport after making security upgrade recommendations in 2006. Calling Ben Gurion \"the world\\'s safest airport,\" Antonio Villaraigosa, mayor of Los Angeles, has implemented the Israeli review in order to bring state-of-the-art technology and other tactical measures to help secure LAX, considered to be the state\\'s primary terrorist target and singled out by the Al Qaeda network. New Age Security Solutions, led by the former director of security at Ben Gurion and based in Washington, D.C., consults on aviation security at Boston\\'s Logan International Airport.Other U.S. airports to incorporate Israeli tactics and systems include Port of Oakland and the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. \"The Israelis are legendary for their security, and this is an opportunity to see firsthand what they do, how they do it and, as importantly, the theory behind it,\" said Steven Grossman, director of aviation at the Port of Oakland. He was so impressed with a briefing presented by the Israelis that he suggested a trip to Israel to the U.S. branch of Airports Council International in order to gain a deeper understanding of the methods employed by Israeli airport security and law enforcement.\\n\\n\\n=== Pakistan ===\\nIn Pakistan Airports Security Force (ASF) is responsible for protecting the airports and the facilities and the planes. ASF safeguards the civil aviation industry against unlawful interference, adopting counter terrorism measures, preventing crime and maintaining law and order within the limits of airports in Pakistan.\\n\\n\\n=== Singapore ===\\n\\nSecurity for the country\\'s two international passenger airports comes under the purview of the Airport Police Division of the Singapore Police Force, although resources are concentrated at Singapore Changi Airport where scheduled passenger traffic dominates. Seletar Airport, which specializes in handling non-scheduled and training flights, is seen as posing less of a security issue. Since the September 11 attacks, and the naming of Changi Airport as a terrorism target by the Jemaah Islamiyah, the airport\\'s security has been stepped up.\\nRoving patrol teams of two soldiers and a police officer armed with automatic weapons patrol the terminals at random.\\nDeparting passengers are checked at the entrance of the gate rather than after immigration clearance unlike Hong Kong International Airport. This security measure is easily noticed by the presence of X-ray machines and metal detectors at every gate, which is not normally seen at other airports.\\nAssisting the state organizations, are the security services provided by the ground handlers, namely that of the Certis CISCO, Singapore Airport Terminal Services\\'s SATS Security Services, and the Aetos Security Management Private Limited, formed from a merger of the Changi International Airport Services\\'s airport security unit and that of other companies to become a single island-wide auxiliary police company. These officers\\' duties include screening luggage and controlling movement into restricted areas.\\nSince 2005, an upgrade in screening technology and rising security concerns led to all luggage-screening processes being conducted behind closed doors. Plans are also in place to install over 400 cameras to monitor the airport, to discourage bomb attacks similar to the 2005 Songkhla bombings in Southern Thailand where Hat Yai International Airport was targeted. Tenders to incorporate such a system were called in late September 2005.Since 8 May 2007, the liquid restrictions of 100 ml cap is enforced, following the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. Passengers are advised to check in liquids, gels and aerosols above 100 ml, failing which they will be confiscated by airport security and have to post it back to oneself. Anything that is in the security areas is allowed. In general practice, unacceptable materials are also confiscated and have to post it back to yourself (excluding nail clippers, nail files, umbrellas and racquets).\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\n\\nPrior to the 1970s, American airports had minimal security arrangements to prevent acts of terrorism. For some flights with unassigned seating, no reservations were required, and fares were collected in the air. Federal security personnel started serving on high-risk flights in 1962 as the FAA Peace Officers Program; sky marshals began working out of the Miami field office of the United States Marshals Service in 1969. (Hijackers typically wanted to defect to Cuba, making flights from Florida common targets.) There were insufficient numbers to protect every flight, and hijackings continued to take place. The first hijacking resulting in a fatality occurred on Eastern Air Lines Shuttle Flight 1320 in 1970. Later in 1970, sky marshall staffing was increased, and some passengers fitting a behavioral profile were screened for weapons (including with handheld metal detectors).On November 10, 1972, a trio of hijackers threatened to fly Southern Airways Flight 49 into a nuclear reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. As a direct response to this incident, the Federal Aviation Administration required all airlines to begin screening passengers and their carry-on baggage by January 5, 1973. This screening was generally contracted to private security companies. Private companies would bid on these contracts. The airline that had operational control of the departure concourse controlled by a given checkpoint would hold that contract. Although an airline would control the operation of a checkpoint, oversight authority was held by the FAA. C.F.R. Title 14 restrictions did not permit a relevant airport authority to exercise any oversight over checkpoint operations. The 1974 film, The Parallax View, shows an early airport security checkpoint in operation.\\nThe September 11 attacks prompted even tougher regulations, such as limiting the number of and types of items passengers could carry on board aircraft and requiring increased screening for passengers who fail to present a government-issued photo ID.\\nThe Aviation and Transportation Security Act generally required that by November 19, 2002, all passenger screening must be conducted by federal employees. As a result, passenger and baggage screening is now provided by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Provisions to improve the technology for detecting explosives were included in the Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Often, security at category X airports, the U.S. largest and busiest as measured by volume of passenger traffic, is provided by private contractors. Because of the high volume of passenger traffic, category X airports are considered vulnerable targets for terrorism.\\nFollowing the failed 2006 liquid bomb plot, United States Homeland Security banned all liquids and gels except baby formula and prescription medicines in the name of the ticket holder in carry-on luggage on all flights and started requiring all passengers to remove their shoes for screening.From 13 August 2006, airline passengers in the United States could take up to 3.4 US fl oz (101 ml) of non-prescription medicine, glucose gel for diabetics, solid lipstick, and baby food aboard flights. Eventually passengers were allowed to carry only 100 ml (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz) of liquid in their hand luggage, TSA standards required all non-medical liquids to be kept in a quart-sized plastic bag, with only one bag per passenger.With the increase in security screening, some airports saw long queues for security checks. To alleviate this, airports created Premium lines for passengers traveling in First or Business Class, or those who were elite members of a particular airline\\'s Frequent Flyer program.\\nThe \"Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques\" (SPOT) program is operating at some U.S. airports.\\n\\n\\n==== Category X Airports in the United States ====\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nAir travel with firearms and ammunition\\nAirport privacy\\nInfrastructure security\\nSecurity theaterUS specific:\\n\\nComputer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System\\nRegistered Traveler\\nAirport racial profiling in the United States\\nSecondary Security Screening Selection\\nSecure Flight\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nCanadian Air Transport Security Authority\\nTransport Canada\\nU.S. FAA\\nU.S. Transportation Security Administration\\nSociedad Europea de Detección\\nIndian Aviation Security\\n'], ['Airspace', 'Airports', 'Airspace is the portion of the atmosphere controlled by a country above its territory, including its territorial waters or, more generally, any specific three-dimensional portion of the atmosphere. It is not the same as aerospace, which is the general term for Earth\\'s atmosphere and the outer space in its vicinity.\\nWithin the United States:\\n\\nControlled airspace exists where it is deemed necessary that air traffic control has some form of positive executive control over aircraft flying in that airspace (however, air traffic control does not necessarily control traffic operating under visual flight rules (VFR) within this airspace).Airspace may be further subdivided into a variety of areas and zones, including those where there are either restrictions on flying activities or complete prohibition of flying activities.\\n\\n\\n== Horizontal boundary ==\\n\\nBy international law, a state \"has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory\", which corresponds with the maritime definition of territorial waters as being 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) out from a nation\\'s coastline. Airspace not within any country\\'s territorial limit is considered international, analogous to the \"high seas\" in maritime law.\\nHowever, a country may, by international agreement, assume responsibility for controlling parts of international airspace, such as those over the oceans. Such airspace in respect of which a country is responsible under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for operational control is called a Flight Information Region (FIR). For a coastal state, the FIR consists of the airspace above its land and sea territory plus any international airspace in respect of which ICAO has assigned responsibility to that state.For instance, the United States provides air traffic control services over a large part of the Pacific Ocean, even though the airspace is international.\\n\\n\\n== Vertical boundary ==\\nThere is no international agreement on the vertical extent of sovereign airspace, with suggestions ranging from about 30 km (19 mi)—the extent of the highest aircraft and balloons—to about 160 km (100 mi)—thought to be the lowest extent of short-term stable orbits, disproved by the satellite Lixing-1 having a stable orbit with an apogee of 140 km (87 mi) for three days. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale has established the Kármán line—at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi)—as the boundary between the Earth\\'s atmosphere and outer space, while the United States considers anyone who has flown above 80 kilometres (50 mi) to be an astronaut. Indeed, descending Space Shuttles flew closer than 80 km (50 mi) over other nations, such as Canada, without requesting permission first. Nonetheless, both the Kármán line and the U.S. definition are merely working benchmarks, without any real legal authority over matters of national sovereignty.\\nThe boundary between public airspace and private air rights is defined by national or local law.\\n\\n\\n== Controlled airspace ==\\n\\nControlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different classifications of airspace and defined dimensions within which air traffic control (ATC) service is provided in accordance with the airspace classification. Controlled airspace consists of:\\nClass A\\nClass B\\nClass C\\nClass D\\nClass E\\n\\n\\n=== Class A airspace ===\\nClass A airspace is generally the airspace from 18,000 feet (3.41 miles) mean sea level (MSL) up to and including flight level (FL) 600, including the airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles (NM) of the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska. Unless otherwise authorized, all operation in Class A airspace is conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR).\\n\\n\\n=== Class B airspace ===\\nClass B airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation\\'s busiest airports in terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements. The configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually tailored, consists of a surface area and two or more layers (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding cakes), and is designed to contain all published instrument procedures once an aircraft enters the airspace. An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive separation services within the airspace.\\n\\n\\n=== Class C airspace ===\\nClass C airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements. Although the configuration of each Class C area is individually tailored, the airspace usually consists of a surface area with a five NM radius, an outer circle with a ten NM radius that extends from 1,200 feet to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, and an outer area. Each aircraft must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the airspace.\\n\\n\\n=== Class D airspace ===\\nClass D airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower. The configuration of each Class D airspace area is individually tailored and when instrument procedures are published, the airspace is normally designed to contain the procedures. Arrival extensions for instrument approach procedures (IAPs) may be Class D or Class E airspace. Unless otherwise authorized, each aircraft must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while in the airspace.\\n\\n\\n=== Class E airspace ===\\nIf the airspace is not Class A, B, C, or D, and is controlled airspace, then it is Class E airspace. Class E airspace extends upward from either the surface or a designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace. When designated as a surface area, the airspace is configured to contain all instrument procedures. Also in this class are federal airways, airspace beginning at either 700 or 1,200 feet above ground level (AGL) used to transition to and from the terminal or en route environment, and en route domestic and offshore airspace areas designated below 18,000 feet MSL. Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E airspace begins at 14,500 MSL over the United States, including that airspace overlying the waters within 12 NM of the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL, and the airspace above FL 600. Class E has control services available but VFR pilots are not required to make any contact with ATC unlike other controlled airspace.\\n\\n\\n== Uncontrolled airspace ==\\n\\n\\n=== Class G airspace ===\\nUncontrolled airspace or Class G airspace is the portion of the airspace that has not been designated as Class A, B, C, D, or E. It is therefore designated uncontrolled airspace by the ATC. Class G airspace extends from the surface to the base of the overlying Class E airspace.  Although ATC has no authority or responsibility to control air traffic, pilots should remember there are visual flight rules (VFR) minimums which apply to Class G airspace, and that flight over private property should not be presumed valid.      \\n\\n\\n== Special use airspace ==\\n\\nSpecial use airspace or special area of operation (SAO) is the designation for airspace in which certain activities must be confined, or where limitations may be imposed on aircraft operations that are not part of those activities. Certain special use airspace areas can create limitations on the mixed use of airspace. The special use airspace depicted on instrument charts includes the area name or number, effective altitude, time and weather conditions of operation, the controlling agency, and the chart panel location. On National Aeronautical Charting Group (NACG) en route charts, this information is available on one of the end panels. Special use airspace usually consists of:\\n\\nProhibited areas\\nRestricted areas\\nWarning areas\\nMilitary operation areas (MOAs)\\nAlert areas\\nControlled firing areas (CFAs)\\n\\n\\n=== Prohibited areas ===\\n\\nProhibited areas contain airspace of defined dimensions within which the flight of aircraft is prohibited. Such areas are established for security or other reasons associated with the national welfare. Prohibited areas in the United States are published in the Federal Register and are depicted on aeronautical charts. The area is charted as a \"P\" followed by a number (e.g., P-49). Examples of prohibited areas include Camp David and the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where the White House and the Congressional buildings are located.\\n\\n\\n=== Restricted areas ===\\n\\nRestricted areas are areas where operations are hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft and contain airspace within which the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject to restrictions. Activities within these areas must be confined because of their nature, or limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or both. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often invisible, hazards to aircraft (e.g., artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or guided missiles). IFR flights may be authorized to transit the airspace and are routed accordingly. Penetration of restricted areas without authorization from the using or controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its occupants. ATC facilities apply the following procedures when aircraft are operating on an IFR clearance (including those cleared by ATC to maintain VFR on top) via a route which lies within joint-use restricted airspace:\\n\\nIf the restricted area is not active and has been released to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the ATC facility allows the aircraft to operate in the restricted airspace without issuing specific clearance for it to do so.\\nIf the restricted area is active and has not been released to the FAA, the ATC facility issues a clearance which ensures the aircraft avoids the restricted airspace.Restricted areas are charted with an \"R\" followed by a number (e.g., R-4401) and are depicted on the en route chart appropriate for use at the altitude or FL being flown. Restricted area information can be obtained on the back of the chart.\\n\\n\\n=== Warning areas ===\\nWarning areas are similar in nature to restricted areas; however, the United States government does not have sole jurisdiction over the airspace. A warning area is airspace of defined dimensions, extending from 12 NM outward from the coast of the United States, containing activity that may be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. The purpose of such areas is to warn nonparticipating pilots of the potential danger. A warning area may be located over domestic or international waters or both. The airspace is designated with a \"W\" followed by a number (e.g., W-237).\\n\\n\\n=== Military operation areas (MOAs) ===\\n\\nMOAs consist of airspace with defined vertical and lateral limits established for the purpose of separating certain military training activities from IFR traffic. Whenever an MOA is being used, nonparticipating IFR traffic may be cleared through an MOA if IFR separation can be provided by ATC. Otherwise, ATC reroutes or restricts nonparticipating IFR traffic. MOAs are depicted on sectional, VFR terminal area, and en route low altitude charts and are not numbered (e.g., \"Camden Ridge MOA\"). [Figure 14-5] However, the MOA is also further defined on the back of the sectional charts with times of operation, altitudes affected, and the controlling agency.\\n\\n\\n=== Alert areas ===\\nAlert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts with an \"A\" followed by a number (e.g., A-211) to inform nonparticipating pilots of areas that may contain a high volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial activity. Pilots should exercise caution in alert areas. All activity within an alert area shall be conducted in accordance with regulations, without waiver, and pilots of participating aircraft, as well as pilots transiting the area, shall be equally responsible for collision avoidance.\\n\\n\\n=== Controlled firing areas (CFAs) ===\\nCFAs contain activities, which, if not conducted in a controlled environment, could be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. The difference between CFAs and other special use airspace is that activities must be suspended when a spotter aircraft, radar, or ground lookout position indicates an aircraft might be approaching the area. There is no need to chart CFAs since they do not cause a nonparticipating aircraft to change its flightpath.\\n\\n\\n== Other airspace areas ==\\n\"Other airspace areas\" is a general term referring to the majority of the remaining airspace. It includes:\\n\\nLocal airport advisory\\nMilitary training route (MTR)\\nTemporary flight restriction (TFR)\\nParachute jump aircraft operations\\nPublished VFR routes\\nTerminal radar service area (TRSA)\\nNational security area (NSA)\\n\\n\\n=== Local airport advisory (LAA) ===\\n\\nA service provided by facilities, which are located on the landing airport, have a discrete ground-to-air communication frequency or the tower frequency when the tower is closed, automated weather reporting with voice broadcasting, and a continuous ASOS/AWOS data display, other continuous direct reading instruments, or manual observations available to the specialist.\\n\\n\\n=== Military training routes (MTRs) ===\\n\\nMTRs are routes used by military aircraft to maintain proficiency in tactical flying. These routes are usually established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds in excess of 250 knots. Some route segments may be defined at higher altitudes for purposes of route continuity. Routes are identified as IFR (IR), and VFR (VR), followed by a number. [Figure 14-7] MTRs with no segment above 1,500 feet AGL are identified by four number characters (e.g., IR1206, VR1207). MTRs that include one or more segments above 1,500 feet AGL are identified by three number characters (e.g., IR206, VR207). IFR low altitude en route charts depict all IR routes and all VR routes that accommodate operations above 1,500 feet AGL. IR routes are conducted in accordance with IFR regardless of weather conditions. VFR sectional charts depict military training activities such as IR, VR, MOA, restricted area, warning area, and alert area information.\\n\\n\\n=== Temporary flight restrictions (TFR) ===\\n\\nA flight data center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is issued to designate a TFR. The NOTAM begins with the phrase \"FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS\" followed by the location of the temporary restriction, effective time period, area defined in statute miles, and altitudes affected. The NOTAM also contains the FAA coordination facility and telephone number, the reason for the restriction, and any other information deemed appropriate. The pilot should check the NOTAMs as part of flight planning.Some of the purposes for establishing a TFR are:\\n\\nProtect persons and property in the air or on the surface from an existing or imminent hazard.\\nProvide a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft.\\nPrevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident or event, which may generate a high degree of public interest.\\nProtect declared national disasters for humanitarian reasons in the State of Hawaii.\\nProtect the President, Vice President, or other public figures.\\nProvide a safe environment for space agency operations.Since the events of September 11, 2001, the use of TFRs has become much more common. There have been a number of incidents of aircraft incursions into TFRs, which have resulted in pilots undergoing security investigations and certificate suspensions. It is a pilot\\'s responsibility to be aware of TFRs in their proposed area of flight. One way to check is to visit the FAA website([1]), and verify that there is not a TFR in the area.\\n\\n\\n=== Parachute jump aircraft operations ===\\nParachute jump aircraft operations are published in the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD). Sites that are used frequently are depicted on sectional charts.\\n\\n\\n=== Published VFR routes ===\\nPublished VFR routes are for transitioning around, under, or through some complex airspace. Terms such as VFR flyway, VFR corridor, Class B airspace VFR transition route, and terminal area VFR route have been applied to such routes. These routes are generally found on VFR terminal area planning charts.\\n\\n\\n=== Terminal radar service areas (TRSAs) ===\\n\\nTRSAs are areas where participating pilots can receive additional radar services. The purpose of the service is to provide separation between all IFR operations and participating VFR aircraft.The primary airport(s) within the TRSA become(s) Class D airspace. The remaining portion of the TRSA overlies other controlled airspace, which is normally Class E airspace beginning at 700 or 1,200 feet and established to transition to/from the en route/terminal environment. TRSAs are depicted on VFR sectional charts and terminal area charts with a solid black line and altitudes for each segment. The Class D portion is charted with a blue segmented line. Participation in TRSA services is voluntary; however, pilots operating under VFR are encouraged to contact the radar approach control and take advantage of TRSA service.\\n\\n\\n=== National Security Areas (NSAs) ===\\n\\nNSAs consist of airspace of defined vertical and lateral dimensions established at locations where there is a requirement for increased security and safety of ground facilities. Flight in NSAs may be temporarily prohibited by regulation under the provisions of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 99, and prohibitions are disseminated via NOTAM. Pilots are requested to voluntarily avoid flying through these depicted areas.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAir sovereignty\\nAirspace class\\nFlyover rights\\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nopen flightmaps\\nU.S. airspace, as described in the Aeronautical Information Manual\\nAirSpace Technology\\nWorldwide Soaring Turnpoint Exchange: Airspace (publicly contributed data)\\nAirspace data in Google Earth Format (KML)\\nGraham Warwick (18 September 2018). \"Airbus Proposes Blueprint For Integrating Autonomous Aviation\".

It is not the same as aerospace, which is the general term for Earth\\'s atmosphere and the outer space in its vicinity.\\nWithin the United States:\\n\\nControlled airspace exists where it is deemed necessary that air traffic control has some form of positive executive control over aircraft flying in that airspace (however, air traffic control does not necessarily control traffic operating under visual flight rules (VFR) within this airspace).Airspace may be further subdivided into a variety of areas and zones, including those where there are either restrictions on flying activities or complete prohibition of flying activities.\\n\\n\\n== Horizontal boundary ==\\n\\nBy international law, a state \"has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory\", which corresponds with the maritime definition of territorial waters as being 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) out from a nation\\'s coastline. Airspace not within any country\\'s territorial limit is considered international, analogous to the \"high seas\" in maritime law.\\nHowever, a country may, by international agreement, assume responsibility for controlling parts of international airspace, such as those over the oceans. Such airspace in respect of which a country is responsible under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for operational control is called a Flight Information Region (FIR). For a coastal state, the FIR consists of the airspace above its land and sea territory plus any international airspace in respect of which ICAO has assigned responsibility to that state.For instance, the United States provides air traffic control services over a large part of the Pacific Ocean, even though the airspace is international.\\n\\n\\n== Vertical boundary ==\\nThere is no international agreement on the vertical extent of sovereign airspace, with suggestions ranging from about 30 km (19 mi)—the extent of the highest aircraft and balloons—to about 160 km (100 mi)—thought to be the lowest extent of short-term stable orbits, disproved by the satellite Lixing-1 having a stable orbit with an apogee of 140 km (87 mi) for three days. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale has established the Kármán line—at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi)—as the boundary between the Earth\\'s atmosphere and outer space, while the United States considers anyone who has flown above 80 kilometres (50 mi) to be an astronaut. Indeed, descending Space Shuttles flew closer than 80 km (50 mi) over other nations, such as Canada, without requesting permission first. Nonetheless, both the Kármán line and the U.S. definition are merely working benchmarks, without any real legal authority over matters of national sovereignty.\\nThe boundary between public airspace and private air rights is defined by national or local law.\\n\\n\\n== Controlled airspace ==\\n\\nControlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different classifications of airspace and defined dimensions within which air traffic control (ATC) service is provided in accordance with the airspace classification. Controlled airspace consists of:\\nClass A\\nClass B\\nClass C\\nClass D\\nClass E\\n\\n\\n=== Class A airspace ===\\nClass A airspace is generally the airspace from 18,000 feet (3.41 miles) mean sea level (MSL) up to and including flight level (FL) 600, including the airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles (NM) of the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska. Unless otherwise authorized, all operation in Class A airspace is conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR).\\n\\n\\n=== Class B airspace ===\\nClass B airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation\\'s busiest airports in terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements. The configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually tailored, consists of a surface area and two or more layers (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding cakes), and is designed to contain all published instrument procedures once an aircraft enters the airspace. An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive separation services within the airspace.\\n\\n\\n=== Class C airspace ===\\nClass C airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements. Although the configuration of each Class C area is individually tailored, the airspace usually consists of a surface area with a five NM radius, an outer circle with a ten NM radius that extends from 1,200 feet to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, and an outer area. Each aircraft must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the airspace.\\n\\n\\n=== Class D airspace ===\\nClass D airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower. The configuration of each Class D airspace area is individually tailored and when instrument procedures are published, the airspace is normally designed to contain the procedures. Arrival extensions for instrument approach procedures (IAPs) may be Class D or Class E airspace. Unless otherwise authorized, each aircraft must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while in the airspace.\\n\\n\\n=== Class E airspace ===\\nIf the airspace is not Class A, B, C, or D, and is controlled airspace, then it is Class E airspace. Class E airspace extends upward from either the surface or a designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace. When designated as a surface area, the airspace is configured to contain all instrument procedures. Also in this class are federal airways, airspace beginning at either 700 or 1,200 feet above ground level (AGL) used to transition to and from the terminal or en route environment, and en route domestic and offshore airspace areas designated below 18,000 feet MSL. Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E airspace begins at 14,500 MSL over the United States, including that airspace overlying the waters within 12 NM of the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL, and the airspace above FL 600. Class E has control services available but VFR pilots are not required to make any contact with ATC unlike other controlled airspace.\\n\\n\\n== Uncontrolled airspace ==\\n\\n\\n=== Class G airspace ===\\nUncontrolled airspace or Class G airspace is the portion of the airspace that has not been designated as Class A, B, C, D, or E. It is therefore designated uncontrolled airspace by the ATC. Class G airspace extends from the surface to the base of the overlying Class E airspace.  Although ATC has no authority or responsibility to control air traffic, pilots should remember there are visual flight rules (VFR) minimums which apply to Class G airspace, and that flight over private property should not be presumed valid.      \\n\\n\\n== Special use airspace ==\\n\\nSpecial use airspace or special area of operation (SAO) is the designation for airspace in which certain activities must be confined, or where limitations may be imposed on aircraft operations that are not part of those activities. Certain special use airspace areas can create limitations on the mixed use of airspace. The special use airspace depicted on instrument charts includes the area name or number, effective altitude, time and weather conditions of operation, the controlling agency, and the chart panel location. On National Aeronautical Charting Group (NACG) en route charts, this information is available on one of the end panels. Special use airspace usually consists of:\\n\\nProhibited areas\\nRestricted areas\\nWarning areas\\nMilitary operation areas (MOAs)\\nAlert areas\\nControlled firing areas (CFAs)\\n\\n\\n=== Prohibited areas ===\\n\\nProhibited areas contain airspace of defined dimensions within which the flight of aircraft is prohibited. Such areas are established for security or other reasons associated with the national welfare. Prohibited areas in the United States are published in the Federal Register and are depicted on aeronautical charts. The area is charted as a \"P\" followed by a number (e.g., P-49). Examples of prohibited areas include Camp David and the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where the White House and the Congressional buildings are located.\\n\\n\\n=== Restricted areas ===\\n\\nRestricted areas are areas where operations are hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft and contain airspace within which the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject to restrictions. Activities within these areas must be confined because of their nature, or limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or both. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often invisible, hazards to aircraft (e.g., artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or guided missiles). IFR flights may be authorized to transit the airspace and are routed accordingly. Penetration of restricted areas without authorization from the using or controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its occupants. ATC facilities apply the following procedures when aircraft are operating on an IFR clearance (including those cleared by ATC to maintain VFR on top) via a route which lies within joint-use restricted airspace:\\n\\nIf the restricted area is not active and has been released to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the ATC facility allows the aircraft to operate in the restricted airspace without issuing specific clearance for it to do so.\\nIf the restricted area is active and has not been released to the FAA, the ATC facility issues a clearance which ensures the aircraft avoids the restricted airspace.Restricted areas are charted with an \"R\" followed by a number (e.g., R-4401) and are depicted on the en route chart appropriate for use at the altitude or FL being flown. Restricted area information can be obtained on the back of the chart.\\n\\n\\n=== Warning areas ===\\nWarning areas are similar in nature to restricted areas; however, the United States government does not have sole jurisdiction over the airspace. A warning area is airspace of defined dimensions, extending from 12 NM outward from the coast of the United States, containing activity that may be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. The purpose of such areas is to warn nonparticipating pilots of the potential danger. A warning area may be located over domestic or international waters or both. The airspace is designated with a \"W\" followed by a number (e.g., W-237).\\n\\n\\n=== Military operation areas (MOAs) ===\\n\\nMOAs consist of airspace with defined vertical and lateral limits established for the purpose of separating certain military training activities from IFR traffic. Whenever an MOA is being used, nonparticipating IFR traffic may be cleared through an MOA if IFR separation can be provided by ATC. Otherwise, ATC reroutes or restricts nonparticipating IFR traffic. MOAs are depicted on sectional, VFR terminal area, and en route low altitude charts and are not numbered (e.g., \"Camden Ridge MOA\"). [Figure 14-5] However, the MOA is also further defined on the back of the sectional charts with times of operation, altitudes affected, and the controlling agency.\\n\\n\\n=== Alert areas ===\\nAlert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts with an \"A\" followed by a number (e.g., A-211) to inform nonparticipating pilots of areas that may contain a high volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial activity. Pilots should exercise caution in alert areas. All activity within an alert area shall be conducted in accordance with regulations, without waiver, and pilots of participating aircraft, as well as pilots transiting the area, shall be equally responsible for collision avoidance.\\n\\n\\n=== Controlled firing areas (CFAs) ===\\nCFAs contain activities, which, if not conducted in a controlled environment, could be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. The difference between CFAs and other special use airspace is that activities must be suspended when a spotter aircraft, radar, or ground lookout position indicates an aircraft might be approaching the area. There is no need to chart CFAs since they do not cause a nonparticipating aircraft to change its flightpath.\\n\\n\\n== Other airspace areas ==\\n\"Other airspace areas\" is a general term referring to the majority of the remaining airspace. It includes:\\n\\nLocal airport advisory\\nMilitary training route (MTR)\\nTemporary flight restriction (TFR)\\nParachute jump aircraft operations\\nPublished VFR routes\\nTerminal radar service area (TRSA)\\nNational security area (NSA)\\n\\n\\n=== Local airport advisory (LAA) ===\\n\\nA service provided by facilities, which are located on the landing airport, have a discrete ground-to-air communication frequency or the tower frequency when the tower is closed, automated weather reporting with voice broadcasting, and a continuous ASOS/AWOS data display, other continuous direct reading instruments, or manual observations available to the specialist.\\n\\n\\n=== Military training routes (MTRs) ===\\n\\nMTRs are routes used by military aircraft to maintain proficiency in tactical flying. These routes are usually established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds in excess of 250 knots. Some route segments may be defined at higher altitudes for purposes of route continuity. Routes are identified as IFR (IR), and VFR (VR), followed by a number. [Figure 14-7] MTRs with no segment above 1,500 feet AGL are identified by four number characters (e.g., IR1206, VR1207). MTRs that include one or more segments above 1,500 feet AGL are identified by three number characters (e.g., IR206, VR207). IFR low altitude en route charts depict all IR routes and all VR routes that accommodate operations above 1,500 feet AGL. IR routes are conducted in accordance with IFR regardless of weather conditions. VFR sectional charts depict military training activities such as IR, VR, MOA, restricted area, warning area, and alert area information.\\n\\n\\n=== Temporary flight restrictions (TFR) ===\\n\\nA flight data center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is issued to designate a TFR. The NOTAM begins with the phrase \"FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS\" followed by the location of the temporary restriction, effective time period, area defined in statute miles, and altitudes affected. The NOTAM also contains the FAA coordination facility and telephone number, the reason for the restriction, and any other information deemed appropriate. The pilot should check the NOTAMs as part of flight planning.Some of the purposes for establishing a TFR are:\\n\\nProtect persons and property in the air or on the surface from an existing or imminent hazard.\\nProvide a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft.\\nPrevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident or event, which may generate a high degree of public interest.\\nProtect declared national disasters for humanitarian reasons in the State of Hawaii.\\nProtect the President, Vice President, or other public figures.\\nProvide a safe environment for space agency operations.Since the events of September 11, 2001, the use of TFRs has become much more common. There have been a number of incidents of aircraft incursions into TFRs, which have resulted in pilots undergoing security investigations and certificate suspensions. It is a pilot\\'s responsibility to be aware of TFRs in their proposed area of flight. One way to check is to visit the FAA website([1]), and verify that there is not a TFR in the area.\\n\\n\\n=== Parachute jump aircraft operations ===\\nParachute jump aircraft operations are published in the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD). Sites that are used frequently are depicted on sectional charts.\\n\\n\\n=== Published VFR routes ===\\nPublished VFR routes are for transitioning around, under, or through some complex airspace. Terms such as VFR flyway, VFR corridor, Class B airspace VFR transition route, and terminal area VFR route have been applied to such routes. These routes are generally found on VFR terminal area planning charts.\\n\\n\\n=== Terminal radar service areas (TRSAs) ===\\n\\nTRSAs are areas where participating pilots can receive additional radar services.

Ajman is surrounded on its landlocked north, south and eastern borders by Sharjah. The airport is being constructed in the eastern district of Ajman, in the Al Manama enclave. This construction project is one worth $571 million which is forecasted to accommodate for 1 million passengers and a minimum of 400,000 tonnes of cargo when completed. It has an expected completion date of late 2020. This is set to enable more accessible travel to Ajman and encourages development on the surrounding area with plans to expand and open hotels, restaurants, commercial offices, residential units, retail, educational centres and exhibition halls. According to a feasibility study by ICTS Europe and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) new construction project is set to achieve more than 1 million passengers within the first three years of opening and operating.As of February 2021, construction has not started yet and the project is probably canceled or on hold.\\n\\n\\n== Location ==\\n\\nAjman International Airport will be located in the smallest emirate of the United Arab Emirates, Ajman. Ajman is landlocked in the north, south and eastern borders by Sharjah which is the current closest international airport to Ajman. The new airport facility is being constructed with an area of 60 million square feet, 60 km away from Ajman City, in the eastern district of Ajman, in the Al Manama enclave, linking Fujairah on the east coast and Sharjah on the west coast. The site is in a location in the heart of the Northern Emirates and connected by the existing road infrastructure to other emirates.\\nCurrently, to engage in international travel, residents of Ajman must travel hours to Dubai and Sharjah to the nearest airport. This further applies to imports and export cargo. This construction project allows for the ease of import and exports of goods to and from Ajman and global destinations.As 90% of the population currently resides in the city, the Ajman International Airport will help facilitate a wider spread of the population within the emirate along the city and Al Manama enclave.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe Government of Ajman granted White Lake Consortium (WLC) the initial sole concession to design, build and operate the upcoming airport. Other corporations involved in this construction project are ICTS Europe, Steel Law, Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and Fakhruddin Group, a United Arab Emirates based developer. In September 2014, the Crown Prince of Ajman, Prince Sheikh Ammar Bin Humaid Al Nuaimi provided final approval to Whitelake Consortium (WLC) to build and operate the proposed Ajman International Airport development plan which is approximately AED1.2 billion (US$570 million). The first phase of the construction project was set to build the initial terminal buildings for departures and arrivals, runways, a cargo complex, aviation school, maintenance workshops, free zone and a commercial zone. The new airport was to have capacity for 1 million passengers annually by 2018. This was to increase Ajman's tourism numbers within the emirate.In February 2015, the CEO of the Ajman International Airport, Rashido Omrani claimed the airport was still to be expected to be completed in 2018. This construction project was said to include extra space for a large MRO centre and a terminal with capacity even greater than 1 million passengers. Delays in the construction of the airport constantly occurring has led to the new completion date to be by 31 December 2020.The facilities of this airport have been designed, with a 4000-metre-long runway, to accept aircraft like the Airbus A380. To expand airport usage facilities to serve the needs of the air cargo and logistics, maintenance and executive aircraft operations will be created.\\n\\n\\n== Operations ==\\nThe Ajman International Airport has operational guidelines based upon those of surrounding emirates. However, further intervention as well as experimentation once the airport begins operating is required due to the high amount of air traffic with limited air space in the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n\\n=== Facilities ===\\nIn these early stages of construction and opening, twenty-five airlines including Emirates, Etihad and Air Arabia have sent letters of intent for landing rights at this airport. To accommodate for employees of the airport as well as other investments in the airport area, multiple residential and commercial properties will be developed alongside this as the airport will be located 60 km outside the Ajman city. The Ajman International Airport has provoked further construction such as retailers and restaurants in the surrounding area which is able to accommodate to staff of the airport due to the airport's profound distance from the main city centre and residential units. This further accommodates to tourists on limited time layovers which in turn, boosts economic activity in the emirate.\\n\\n\\n=== Flight movements ===\\n\\nAjman International Airport, after its initial completion will begin with transporting cargo then with flying passengers to other emirates within the United Arab Emirates and will then further begin its international flights as the domestic flights run smoothly to alleviate any issues with the function and processes. After initial flights, this will further extend passenger flights internationally. However, as this construction project is not set to be a large international airport to the measure of that of other emirates in the United Arab Emirates, international flights will be limited to closer destinations and accommodate to layovers.\\n\\n\\n=== Regulation ===\\nThe director of the Aviation Authority, Saif, Al Suwaidi stated that the approval for the operations of the airport in Ajman require evaluating the common airspace and agreements among the other airports operating in the other emirates of the United Arab Emirates including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah. The close proximity of these five airports poses major challenges for the establishment of the Ajman International airport due to the limited airspace. The Aviation Authority is in the process of holding meetings with all airports, more specifically, in the north of the United Arab Emirates such as Dubai, Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah to continue achieving the highest level of safety for air traffic in the country. This will be further tested and implemented in the initial stages of opening and running the airport with beginning in low cost carrier (LCC) and cargo transportation as the primary use. Through testing and enforcing different regulations in cargo transportation, the airport will further begin to engage in other functions and processes, including passenger travel.\\n\\n\\n=== Security ===\\nAjman International Airport, being part of the United Arab Emirates will follow after its neighbouring emirates such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi in terms of the security measures taken when entering the country. This further includes restrictions on fire, explosives, illicit substances and guns. This further extends to carry on luggage in terms of liquid, sharp objects and flammable item restrictions. Furthermore, similar to that of Abu Dhabi International Airport and Dubai International Airport, passengers engaging in layover flights will also have security measures with carry on luggage x-ray scanners and walk through metal detectors regardless of whether they will be exiting the Ajman International Airport to go to Ajman itself.\\n\\n\\n== Airlines and Destinations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Passengers ===\\nAfter its opening in 2021, when passengers are able to fly, Ajman International Airport, is set to cater to a minimum of one million passengers per annum and is estimated to rise up to 10.4 million by 2046. This airport is set to be driven largely by low cost carrier (LCC) and cargo operations in the first initial phase of its opening, the new airport is projected to achieve a significant amount of international passenger traffic over five years of it opening. However, 70% of its air traffic is set to come from low cost carriers (LCC) and 30% from regional flights. Although Ajman International Airport is set to cater to this large amount, it is not set to be equal to the measure of airports of other larger emirates such as Abu Dhabi and Dubai, specifically in passenger transportation.\\n\\n\\n=== Cargo ===\\nAfter the opening of the airport, Ajman International Airport intends on beginning its processes and functions with cargo. This allows for the airport to further assess efficiency of the airport's functionality and make improvements fit for passengers to begin travel. Ajman International Airport will accommodate a minimum of 400,000 tonnes of cargo. Due to the emirate's smaller size in terms of area and population, the airport is set to also be smaller than that of neighbouring emirates such as Dubai International Airport and Sharjah International Airport. Therefore, cargo and airport maintenance are set to make up most of the airport's business. This further facilitates trade to occur within the United Arab Emirates and boost the economy by adding additional trading ports, specifically, the Ajman International Airport.\\n\\n\\n== Access ==\\nDue to the surrounding construction of residential units to occur around the Ajman International Airport, the commute is set to be quick for locals living in the surrounding area. However, this may be difficult for locals living in Ajman City as the airport construction site is 60 km away from the main city. Due to the minimal public transport available in Ajman, the airport will be accessible mainly by private cars and taxis, specifically for those living in the city. Currently, due to the lack of air transportation in existence in Ajman, residents are required to travel to Sharjah airport, one hour away or Dubai airport, one and a half hours away via a car or one bus from Ajman to Dubai which runs hourly. Ajman is only 12 km from Sharjah Airport which is the major base for Air Arabia from where approximately 19 airlines operated more than 35,000 scheduled flights in 2017. The current large air transportation hub of Dubai International Airport is a further 15 km away with one of the world's largest passenger air transportation, approximately 81 scheduled passenger airlines and 199,000 flights in 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Future Expansions and Plans ==\\n\\nA feasibility study was conducted by ICTS Europe, an aviation specialist and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), an international consultancy firm. According to His Highness Shaikh Humaid Bun Rashid Al Nuaimi, member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of the emirate of Ajman, after reviewing the feasibility study, claims the new airport construction project aims to meet the growing demand for aviation infrastructure in the United Arab Emirates. As the Ajman International airport brings more people into this emirate and boosts tourism as well as occupancy of resorts, further expansions and developments of the area will occur. Although this airport does not aim to compete with other larger airports in the country, it aims to further contribute to tourism revenue with a considerable number of hotels also growing in recent years. Tourism in Ajman has been undergoing rapid growth after recovering from the financial crisis in 2007-2008. Popular attractions and locations for tourists, facilitating this rapid growth, include the Ajman National Museum located at Ajman Fort, the Red fort and the museum in the inland enclave of Manama, near where the construction site of the new airport is situated. Ajman's corniche is also a popular tourist destination for families, contributing to this rapid tourism growth, featuring a number of fast food retailers, coffee shops and stalls. Expatriates of Ajman often venture to the ‘Outside Inn,’ a popular watering hole which also possesses a number of hotels such as Ramada, Ajman Palace, the Kempinski the Ajman Saray and the Fairmont Ajman which further boosts economic upturn from tourism in Ajman.This airport will be open for big businesses and allows to provide more income for the emirate. This airport is estimated to create over 28,000 new jobs such as border security, taxi drivers, retailers, flight attendants, builders and pilots. The United Arab Emirates plans to invest $USD136 billion in aviation infrastructure in the next 10 years and has an estimate of 15 million to tourists by 2020. Taking into consideration this growth in tourism, this airport construction project, aims to expand and open more hotels, restaurants, commercial offices, residential units, retailers, educational centres and exhibition halls. The additional construction projects to come in response to the Ajman International Airport are further set to boost the overall economy for the emirate alongside the airport.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nhttp://www.arabianbusiness.com/ajman-crown-prince-approves-571m-airport-plans-564682.html\\nhttp://www.dubaifaqs.com/ajman-airport.php\\nhttp://www.thenational.ae/uae/transport/residents-and-businesses-welcome-plans-for-airport-in-ajman\\nhttp://www.constructionweekonline.com/projects-162-ajman_international_airport/\\nhttp://meconstructionnews.com/8944/top-10-gulf-airport-projects\\nhttp://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/ajman-builds-new-airport-and-two-ports-1.1338993\\n\"], ['Akabeko', 'Building', \"Akabeko (赤べこ, Akabeko, red bull) is a legendary cow from the Aizu region of Japan, who inspired a traditional toy. Aizu legend claims that the toys are based on a real cow used to build the Enzō-ji temple of Yanaizu in the ninth century.\\nThe toy is made out of two pieces of papier-mâché-covered wood, shaped and painted to look like a red cow or ox. One piece represents the cow's head and neck and the other its body. The head and neck hangs from a string and fits into the hollow body. When the toy is moved, the head thus bobs up and down and side to side. The earliest akabeko toys were created in the late 16th or early 17th century.\\nOver time, people came to believe that the toys could ward off smallpox and other illnesses. Akabeko has become one of Fukushima Prefecture's most famous crafts and a symbol of the Aizu region. It has also been recognized as a symbol of the larger Tōhoku region, of which Fukushima Prefecture is a part.\\n\\n\\n== Origin of the legend ==\\nAccording to an Aizu-area legend recorded by Thomas Madden, akabeko toys are based upon a real cow that lived in CE 807. At that time, a monk named Tokuichi was supervising the construction of Enzō-ji, a temple in Yanaizu, Fukushima. Upon the temple's completion, the akabeko gave its spirit to Buddha, and its flesh immediately turned to stone.\\nAnother version of the tale claims that the cow instead refused to leave the temple grounds after construction had been completed and became a permanent fixture there. The red cow was called akabeko (赤べこ, akabeko, beko is Aizu dialect for cow) and became a symbol of zealous devotion to the Buddha.After Toyotomi Hideyoshi had solidified his power over Japan, his representative, Gamō Ujisato, was sent to be the lord of the Aizu region in 1590. At his new post, Ujisato heard the story of akabeko and ordered his court artisans, who had accompanied him from Kyoto, to create a toy based on the red cow. These early papier-mâché akabeko introduced most of the basic elements for which the toy is known.In the same period, Japan suffered a smallpox outbreak. People in Aizu noticed that children who owned akabeko toys did not seem to catch the illness. The akabeko's red colour may have enhanced this association, since red amulets are thought to protect against that illness. Akabeko toys became very popular as charms to ward off sickness, a superstition that persists in modern times. The toy has since become one of the few crafts from Fukushima Prefecture to be known all over Japan and a symbol of the Aizu area.\\n\\n\\n== Production ==\\nAkabeko are made from papier-mâché that is painted and lacquered. The toy consists of two main pieces: the body, and the head and neck. The body is hollow and open on one end. The neck and head fit into this opening, suspended from a piece of string. Whenever the akabeko is moved or jostled, its head bobs up and down and side to side.Akabeko are made by fewer than a dozen family-run workshops, whose members have passed down the technique for generations. The process takes about 10 days to complete. The artisan begins by wrapping wetted washi (Japanese paper) around two blocks of wood, one shaped like the cow's body, and the other shaped like the head and neck. These blocks have often been used for several generations. Once the paper dries, the artisan splits it in two lengthwise and removes the wooden blocks. The craftsperson then rejoins the pieces of molded paper by wrapping more layers of washi around them.The artisan paints the toy, beginning with black, then adding the characteristic red, and finally the white eyes and other details. The akabeko's markings vary from workshop to workshop. For example, the Igarashi family paints the Chinese character kotobuki (寿 longevity and luck) on the cow's back and a sun and moon on its side; other workshops add gold markings. The artisan finishes the toy with a thin coat of lacquer.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAizuhongō ware\\nGamō Ujisato, daimyō of the Sengoku and Azuchi–Momoyama periods\\nOkiagari-koboshi\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n・Akabeko Doll\\n\"], ['Akaflieg', 'Transport', \"Akaflieg is an abbreviation for Akademische Fliegergruppe, groups of aeronautical engineering students from individual German Technical Universities,  pre and postwar, who design aircraft, often gliders.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nOtto Lilienthal published his book Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst (Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation) in 1889.  This described the basics of modern aerodynamics and aircraft construction.  Lilienthal then made many successful flights starting in 1891.  However attention then shifted to powered flight after World War I.\\nGliding re-emerged as a sport after the war because the building of powered aircraft was restricted in Germany by the Treaty of Versailles.  The main originator of the gliding movement was Oskar Ursinus, who in 1920 organised the first contest, known as the Rhön-Contest, on the Wasserkuppe.  Thereafter the contest was held annually. Students of technical universities brought gliders which they had developed and built themselves for testing to these contests. An esprit de corps developed known as Rhöngeist.\\nThese informal beginnings caused the formation of groups of engineers at universities with the aim of scientific and practical education. The first groups were formed in 1920 in Aachen, Darmstadt and Berlin-Charlottenburg, but others soon followed.\\nMany of the first members had been pilots in the German Air Force.  However it was the love of flying rather than militarism or nationalism that motivated them. As a result a fraternal spirit was created that has been maintained to this day.\\nDuring the Nazi period some Akafliegs escaped regulation for a while through the patronage of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL), a forerunner of the present-day German Aerospace Center (DLR), however shortly before World War II the akafliegs were forced to integrate into the NS-Deutsche Studentenbund (Nazi-students-federation). The projects at this time mainly had a military application.\\n\\n\\n== Present day ==\\nAfter the war, the Akafliegs re-formed in 1951, co-ordinated by Interessengemeinschaft Deutscher Akademischer Fliegergruppen e.V. (Idaflieg).  As of 2009 there are ten groups.\\nThe aim of the Akafliegs is the development, design and construction of aeroplanes, especially gliders and scientific research into flight. Much of the practical work is done at the summer meetings of the Idaflieg in co-operation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR), while the results of the research are presented at the winter meetings. The Idaflieg also offers many events and courses to its members such as the specification, design and certification of aeroplanes.\\nThe quality of additional education provided by the Akafliegs is widely respected and so German glider manufacturers recruit almost exclusively from the Akafliegs.\\nMembers have to devote approximately 150 to 300 man-hours annually in order to be able to fly with the Akafliegs. The cost of flying for these members is usually much lower than at other gliding clubs.\\nAmerican Universities have also implemented programs similar to the Akafliegs but based around the American style of teaching, Penn State's AERSP 404H is one example of this implementation.\\n\\nAkaflieg Berlin\\nTechnische Universität Berlin - Berlin Technical UniversityAkaflieg Braunschweig\\nTechnische Universität Braunschweig - Braunschweig University of Technology\\nAkaflieg Darmstadt\\nTechnische Universität Darmstadt - Darmstadt University of TechnologyAkaflieg Dresden\\nTechnische Universität Dresden - Dresden Technical UniversityAkaflieg Erlangen\\nUniversität Erlangen-Nürnberg - University of Erlangen-NurembergAkaflieg Hamburg\\nTechnische Universität Hamburg-Harburg - Technical University of HamburgAkaflieg Hannover\\nLeibniz Universität Hannover - Leibniz University of HannoverAkaflieg Karlsruhe\\nUniversität Karlsruhe - Karlsruhe Institute of TechnologyAkaflieg Köln\\nUniversität zu Köln - Cologne UniversityAkaflieg München\\n''Technische Universität München - Technical University of MunichAkaflieg Stuttgart\\nUniversität Stuttgart - University of StuttgartAkaflieg Wilhelmshaven\\nJade Hochschule - Jade University of Applied SciencesFlugwissenschaftliche Vereinigung Aachen (FV Aachen)\\nRhein-Westphalia Techische Hochschule Aachen Universität - RWTH Aachen University (Rhein-Westphalia Technical High school)Flugwissenschaftliche Arbeitsgemeinschaft Bremen (FWAG Bremen)\\nFlugtechnische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Esslingen (FTAG Esslingen)\\nHochschule Esslingen - Esslingen High SchoolThere are also academical gliding clubs with other focus than building aircraft, like the Akaflieg Frankfurt which is devoted on research of thermals, mountain wave and flight safety.\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nIdaflieg\\nFlugwissenschaftliche Vereinigung Aachen\\nAkademische Fliegergruppe Berlin\\nAkademische Fliegergruppe Braunschweig\\nAkademische Fliegergruppe Darmstadt\\nAkademische Fliegergruppe Dresden\\nFlugtechnische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Esslingen\\nAkademische Fliegergruppe Hannover\\nAkademische Fliegergruppe an der Universität Karlsruhe\\nAkaflieg München\\nAkaflieg Stuttgart\\nAkaflieg Wilhelmshaven\\nAkaflieg Frankfurt\\n[1]\\n[2]\\n[3]\\nde:Akaflieg#Akaflieg Darmstadt Akaflieg article in German\\n\"], ['Akay', 'Artists', \"Akay is one of the first Swedish graffiti-influenced street artists, and has received international attention.\\n\\nWhen he quit graffiti, he started his street art project Akayism.

During his career, he became president of Showa University and also had his photography exhibited and published.\\n\\n\\n== Biography and medical career ==\\nAkira Toriyama was born on 20 June 1898 in Shinagawa-machi, Ebara-gun (now Shinagawa-ku), Tokyo. He studied medicine at Tokyo Imperial University, graduating in 1926. His health was not good, and he is said to have been nudged toward ophthalmology by his own professor, who believed that the relatively stable working hours of an ophthalmologist would be better for Toriyama. In 1928, Toriyama became a professor of ophthalmology at Showa Medical School and he continued at the school as it became Showa Medical University and later Showa University, whose president he became in 1969. Toriyama also became chairman of the university\\'s board of directors; he retired from both positions in 1988 but continued as an adviser. He died on 30 November 1994.\\nToriyama was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class, in 1971, and Upper Fourth Rank (正四位), in 1994.\\n\\n\\n== Photography ==\\nIn 1934, Toriyama realized that his work as an ophthalmologist gave him some spare time, and his uncle the amateur photographer Yasunari Toriyama introduced him to the Japan Photographic Society (JPS), where the skills of the younger man quickly developed. By 1937, his works were appearing in group shows in Paris, France, and Amsterdam, Netherlands, as well as Japan.Toriyama\\'s membership of JPS was central to his photography, and JPS retained (for example as the title of its magazine) Shinzō Fukuhara\\'s phrase from the 1920s, \"Light with its harmony\" (光と其諧調, Hikari to sono kaichō). Ryūichi Kaneko points out that the work of JPS changed with the times: from a start that rejected certain painterly influences on photography but that embraced the subject-matter and composition of traditional Japanese aesthetics, it moved to include the portrayal of urban scenes and fragments. Kaneko says that, influenced by Rosō Fukuhara, Toriyama went further; for example, in his photography of plants \"his emphasis on the sculptural qualities of leaves, stems, and branches is fresh even today\"; further, that his style is similar to that of Shōji Ueda, Akira Nomura, and other photographers of the generation who emerged in the late 1930s and are thought of as modernists rather than pictorialists. Kaneko concludes that \"[Toriyama\\'s] work clearly testifies to [his] Modernist will to live his own life, to express himself, to the full.\"\\nAs his medical career progressed, Toriyama\\'s photography continued but went largely unremarked. Following his death, Tomio Yoshikawa (吉川富夫, Yoshikawa Tomio) of Showa University visited his house and learned that he had left an enormous number of photographs. Yoshikawa soon had a collection of these published. Following this, Toriyama\\'s family and ophthalmologists from Showa University discovered further large numbers of photographs and had selections of these published. First came Photographs by Akira Toriyama (1997), a lavish collection of well over a hundred monochrome photographs from the late thirties, reproduced in sepia. This was followed by A Visit to Showa (1999), a smaller collection of reproductions of colour slides thought to have been taken between 1962 and 1967.

He was arrested and executed in 1938 as part of te Great Purge during the Stalin period.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Career ===\\nIkramov was born in 1898 in an Uzbek family in Tashkent, then part of the Russian Empire. In 1918 he joined the Communist Party. From 1921 to 1922 he was secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Turkestan. In 1922 he moved to Moscow where he studied at the Sverdlov Communist University. While in Moscow, Ikramov kept on campaigning within the Party for raising the cultural level of Turkestan by increasing literacy and building more schools. Meanwhile, Ikramov became involved in a power struggle among the Communists between those favoring a Pan-Turkist government like Turar Ryskulov, and those in favor of dividing the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic into smaller ethnic or regional units, such as Fayzulla Khodzhayev and Ikramov. The latter group won, as national delimitation in Central Asia began in 1924. In January 1925 he became secretary of the Tashkent Oblast committee in the newly formed Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and was also for a time active as chief editor of the magazine Communist. In 1929, he became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan and thus de facto head of government in Soviet Uzbekistan. He was the first ethnic Uzbek in this office, which he held until 1937. In 1930 his predecessor Isaak Zelensky tried to depose him, but since the Central Committee supported Ikramov, this attempt failed. Ikramov led the forced introduction of collectivised agriculture in Uzbekistan, in line with the policy set in Moscow by Joseph Stalin, and implemented a decision to make Uzbekistan the main source of cotton in the USSR. In 1934, he was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the only representative of any of the ethnic Asian minorities.\\n\\n\\n=== Anti-religious policies ===\\nIkramov bore the most responsibility for designing the specifics of the design of anti-Islamic actions during the first five-year plan. Sometimes he personally ordered the arrest of clergymen. Further measures to struggle against the clergy were taken, as Ikramov put it, \"not by prohibitive measures, but by measures developed from broad party-organizational and cultural enlightenment work.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Great Purge ===\\nIn February 1937, near the start of the Great Purge, Ikramov took part in a plenum of the Central Committee which determined the fate of two leading Bolsheviks, Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov, who had led the opposition to forced collectivisation. He denounced them as \"renegades\", accused them of leading an \"uprising against the party, against soviet power\" and called for them to be put on trial. In June, after he had returned to Uzbekistan\\'s capital, Tashkent, his rival, Khodzhayev, was denounced, sacked, and later arrested.  Yet, despite these displays of severity and loyalty to Stalin, Ikramov was publicly censured on 8 September 1937, after the Politburo member Andrey Andreyev had descended on Tashkent, for being sufficiently vigilant in rooting out \\'enemies of the people\\'. On 10 September, he was violently denounced in Pravda for defending a \\'Trotskyite\\' Secretary of the Uzbekistan Central Committee. On 12 September, it was announced that he had been expelled from the party and was under investigation. In October, news broke that he was arrested, together with Khodzhayev.In March 1938, Ikramov was a defendant in the last of the great Moscow show trials, alongside Bukharin and Rykov, whom he had denounced as renegades a year earlier, and his old rivals Zelensky and Khodzhayev. He \\'confessed\\' to having been a Trotskyite since 1923, a leader since 1928 of a secret nationalist movement plotting independence for Uzbekistan, and to having been recruited by Bukharin to the \\'right opposition\\' in 1933. He also \\'confessed\\' that the waste that resulted from over ambitious targets for cotton production and uncompleted construction work had been deliberate sabotage, and that he was a British spy. Ikramov was quoted saying: \"We had to rely on a strong European Power to help us. We thought England most reliable because she is so strong.\" He was sentenced to death on 13 March and shot on 13 March (other sources indicate 15 March) 1938.\\n\\n\\n=== Rehabilitation ===\\n\\nDuring the Khrushchev Thaw, Ikramov\\'s son Kamal requested that the first secretary of Uzbekistan rehabilitate his father. The secretary brought the case to Nikita Khrushchev personally, who then asked Vyacheslav Molotov to look at it. After a year, in 1957, Akmal Ikramov was reinstated in the Party, although the document reinstating him was classified as \"Confidential\".

He is also remembered for his years as a professor at the Royal Danish Academy where he instructed many Danish illustrators.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nAksel Jørgensen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. Jørgensen attended Frede Aamodt's private art school (1905–06) where he met Carl Jensen and Vilhelm Wils. He debuted in 1908 at the Kunstnernes Efterårsudstilling. He exhibited with De Tretten in 1909, presenting his preferred subjects of prostitutes and the destitute living in condemned buildings in the poorest quarters of Copenhagen, attracting the attention of the press. He was also noted for his engravings, characterized by large areas of light and shade and by his use of the grain of the wood, as in his portrait of the writer Jens Pedersen (1908). Together with Storm P., he founded the satirical journal Gnisten (1908), contributing his own sketches.\\nFrom 1909 to 1914, Jørgensen worked on a large series of works illustrating Holger Drachmann's life and poetry for the Drachmann Inn in Frederiksberg. He produced no less than 29 woodcuts during the period, some with multilayered colouring. The art collector Christian Tetzen-Lund commissioned a large group of his works, now characterized by both Rembrandt and, increasingly, Impressionism, inspired by his experience of Cézanne's. work during his travels in 1910. From 1920, he concentrated on composition and perspective, developing the use of colour for still-lifes and figure paintings. Important series included works for the student dormitory Studentergården (1921–23), the cinema Vesterbros Bio (1942) and Arbejdermuseet (1955). His most extensive project consisted of some 50 illustrations for Adam Oehlenschläger's Nordens Guder, published in 1929. It took him many years to engrave the woodcuts and several of his pupils were involved in the technical work. The work had a mixed reception but he was complemented by the French pointillist Paul Signac. He also completed a wide range of portraits including that of the politician Frederik Borgbjerg (1949). In 1935, he became a member of Den Frie Udstilling, an alternative exhibition forum.\\n\\n\\n== Teaching career ==\\nAksel Jørgensen's talents as a teacher were unknown when he was offered a post as professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1920 which he retained until 1953. He encouraged his students to take account of trends across Europe, insisting on the importance of lines and geometrical figures. Special attention was given to composition and perspective based on the careful study of nature. He also organized travelling exhibitions for Danish schools.He became a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1926 and Commander of the 2nd degree in 1943. In 1941, he was awarded the Thorvaldsen Medal for his Prostitution. He died in Copenhagen and was buried in Sorgenfri Cemetery.\\n\\n\\n== Assessment ==\\nJørgensen played an important role in developing the status of graphical work in Denmark. It was he who took the initiative to integrate the graphics school as part of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and it was his work there which attracted important illustrators such as Henry Heerup, Richard Mortensen, Ib Spang Olsen, and many others.

The structure marks the cremation site and serves as a memorial to Gunatitanand Swami. An event was held to commemorate 150 years of the structure in Gondal, the structure as well as the site was renovated to bring it to modern standards.\\n\\n\\n== Religious significance ==\\n\\n\\n=== Samadhi of Gunatitanand Swami ===\\nGunatitanand Swami, who was one of the most important swamis in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya and regarded as the first successor of Swaminarayan by members of the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), died on 21 October 1867, and his funeral rites were performed on the banks of the river Gondali in Gondal, Gujarat in India. The shrine commemorates the site of his cremation.\\n\\n\\n=== Akshar Deri rituals ===\\nSince its construction, the shrine has become a major pilgrimage site within the sect, attracting pilgrims from around the world. A daily morning mahapuja takes place at the shrine. Pilgrims offer their prayers at the altar, chant the Swaminarayan mantra, perform pradakshina (circumambulations) around the shrine, and perform prostrations before the images. Pilgrims perform these rituals as part of praying for the fulfillment of spiritual or worldly wishes.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origin of Akshar Deri ===\\nShortly after Gunatitanand Swami\\'s cremation ceremony, Moghiba, the then Queen Mother of Gondal, had the shrine constructed under the supervision of Abhaysinh Darbar of Ganod. The construction of the shrine started on 28 November 1867 and was completed on 29 January 1868. The shrine was modeled after the shape of the jharukhas (balconies) of the Naulakha Palace in Gondal. Balmukund Swami of Junagadh installed the carved black charanavind or \"holy footprints\" of Swaminarayan inside. Queen Moghiba placed a painted image of Akshar and Purushottam in the shrine and celebrated the festival of Vasant there, beginning the tradition of celebrating other major festivals at the pilgrimage site. Gunatitanand Swami’s birth anniversary was first celebrated at the site on 1 October 1868 by followers of Swaminarayan from the Sorath region.\\nStarting in 1867, the fields surrounding the shrine incurred the name Akshar Vadi, or the orchard of Akshar, in reference to the belief of Gunatitanand Swami as the manifestation of Akshar. The shrine became associated with healing miracles and the fulfillment of prayers recited there.\\n\\n\\n=== Construction of Akshar Mandir ===\\n\\nOn the morning of a Devpodhi Ekadashi, Gunatitanand Swami is said to have appeared before a senior devotee by the name of Narayanji Maharaj of Virsad in a dream and commanded him to build a three-spired shikharbaddha mandir in Gondal at the site of the Deri. Following this dream, Narayanji Maharaj along with three of his disciples Shankarbhai Amin, Haribhai Amin, and Bhikhabhai Shukla went to Gondal, where they requested Bhagvat Singh, the maharaja of the princely state of Gondal, for the land surrounding the Akshar Deri. Bhagvat Singh agreed to sell the land for the temple and set three conditions for its construction: first the temple should be completed in three years; second, the Akshar Deri should be kept intact; and third, no less than 1,000,000 rupees should be spent on the project.On 18 January 1932, Shastriji Maharaj (Shastri Yagnapurushdas) performed the ground breaking ceremony in the presence of Bhagvat Singh. Aksharswarupdas Swami was placed in charge of the temple construction effort with help from Gnanjivandas Swami (Yogiji Maharaj) and other devotees. Swamis and devotees worked around the clock to complete the temple amidst financial hardship and other obstacles. On 24 May 1934, Shastriji Maharaj performed the murti pratistha ceremony and installed the murtis of Akshar Purushottam in the central garbhagriha (sanctum) after the conclusion of a grand yagna, fulfilling Bhagvat Singh\\'s conditions by building the temple around an intact Akshar Deri in two and a quarter years using many more than a million rupees. On the day after the ceremony, Shastriji Maharaj appointed Yogiji Maharaj as the mahant of the temple.\\n\\n\\n=== Other significance ===\\nOn 10 January 1940, Shastri Narayanswarupdas (later Pramukh Swami Maharaj) was given bhagvati diksha or full initiation into ochre robes, by Shastriji Maharaj sitting before the Akshar Deri.A memorial shrine for the fourth spiritual successor, Yogiji Maharaj called the Yogi Smruti Mandir was also constructed here to commemorate his cremation. To commemorate 150 years of the Akshar Deri structure, the Yogi Smruti Mandir was also in turn made anew, a one shikhara mandir now stands at the previous site of the memorial shrine.The Akshar Deri serves as the symbol of the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha - Akshar Deri\\n'], ['Aksjeselskap', 'Companies', \"Aksjeselskap is the Norwegian term for a stock-based company. It is usually abbreviated AS, historically often written as A/S. An AS is always a limited company, i.e. the owners cannot be held liable for any debt beyond the stock capital. Public companies are called Allmennaksjeselskap (ASA), while companies without limited liability are called Ansvarlig selskap (ANS).\\nAll AS companies must have a stock capital of at least NOK 30,000. In addition, they must have a board of directors, depending on the size of turnover, balance sheet total or number of employees, an auditor. They may appoint a managing director (MD) or chief executive (CEO). If the company has assets exceeding NOK 3 million, the board must have at least three members and cannot be chaired by the MD/CEO. Practically all Norwegian companies have a fiscal year from January to December, but some foreign subsidiaries may have a different fiscal year, as is allowed, to match the parent corporation.\\nThe ASA differentiates from the Aksjeselskap in that it has rules regulating its ownership. There cannot be any rules limiting the company's ownership to certain interests, and an ASA must offer a public tender to purchase stock, either new stock or from existing owners if the company is converted from an AS. Norwegian companies, both those listed on a stock exchange and banks, must be ASAs (banks, however, are exempt from certain regulation including ownership regulation).

This can be used to protect the assets of the company against creditors by forming a group of companies. If an A/S is owned by a holding company (typically another A/S), the profit from the production company can be transferred to the holding company. Since there is no liability for the owners of an A/S, creditors from the production company will not be able to claim the profit in case of bankruptcy. Professional creditors, such as banks, protect themselves from this by demanding that the holding company guarantees the debts of the production company.\\n\\n\\n== Formation of an aktieselskab ==\\nThe formation of an aktieselskab requires a number of steps, including the following:\\nNotification concerning the formation to the Danish Business Authorities.\\nRegistration of the company.\\nResolution to form the company at the first general meeting.\\nSubscription for shares and payment of the share capital.

The organization published the legal weekly newspaper that had a regular circulation of 7-8,000, but the circulation occasionally peaked to around 15,000. Al-Jamahir played an important role in the growth of HADITU. Free copies of the newspaper were handed out to workers at factories, and the newspaper became an important rallying point to spread the influence of the movement amongst industrial workers. The newspaper had a relatively high journalistic standard, with photographic essays and industrial exposures.HADITU supported the Egyptian Revolution and the 1952 coup d'état, being the only communist faction to do so. Several prominent figures in the Revolutionary Command Council and the Free Officers had links to HADITU.\\nOther communist groups voiced fierce criticisms against the government in junction with the violent suppression of a strike in Kafr Dawar and the execution of two workers accused of being the leaders of the strike. After the executions of the two labour leaders, HADITU and non-communist trade unionists agitated in the working-class neighbourhoods of Alexandria and Kafr Dawar (in vehicles, with loudspeakers, borrowed from the army) calling on workers to remain calm. The support to the government after the Kafr Dawar crack-down affected the HADITU influence in the labour movement, and created internal rifts between the party and its trade union cadres.\\nIn January 1953 the government closed down the legal press of HADITU and Al-Jamahir was suspended. In February 1955 HADITU merged with six other factions, forming the Unified Egyptian Communist Party.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of newspapers in Egypt\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\"], ['Al-Machriq', 'Universities_and_colleges', \"Al-Machriq (English translation: The East) was a journal founded in 1898 by Jesuit and Chaldean priest Louis Cheikhô, published by Jesuit fathers of Saint Joseph University in Beirut, Lebanon.

The newspaper was established after the early reforms adopted by King Hamad bin Isa. Allowing a key oppositional figure to establish this newspaper was seen as a key event in the opening up of society. Before Al-Wasat was established, Bahrain had only two Arabic newspapers, Akhbar Al Khaleej and Al Ayam, both of which were viewed as extremely pro-government. Its founders are Mansoor Al-Jamri and leading personalities from the Bahraini private sector. Al-Jamri was the editor-in-chief.

Al Wasat newspaper was accused of using old footage and articles when reporting on current events following the Bahraini protests. The Associated Press reported on 3 April that Al Wasat did not publish, following a message on state TV that the Information Ministry had ordered the paper to shut down. According to the state-run Bahrain News Agency, government officials again accused Al-Wasat of \"unethical\" coverage.The day after the suspension, the board of directors of the paper announced they had accepted the resignation of Mansoor Al-Jamri as editor in chief, and Nouwehed as managing editor and head of local news (Aqeel Mirza).

Before this, she was an oceanographic vessel operated by the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, named Professor Albrecht Penck.\\n\\n\\n== Historical ==\\nThe ship was built in 1951 at the Sachsenberg-Werke shipyard. She was launched on 4 June 1951 and completed in September 1951. The ship was part of a construction program for the Soviet Union\\'s war indemnity requirements. The ship remained in the GDR, becoming their first research vessel.\\nOriginally put into service as a hydrographic vessel under the name Joh L. Krueger (after mathematician Johann Heinrich Louis Krüger), the vessel was owned by the Seydrographische Dienst der DDR (SHD). On January 1, 1960, the Institute of Oceanography, where Joh L. Krueger was based, was replaced by the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin. With this change, the ship was renamed Professor Albrecht Penck (after the second director of the Institute and Museum of Oceanography in Berlin).\\nThe GDR used the ship for research trips in the North and Baltic Seas. In 1962, the first East German Spitsbergen expedition took place, with Professor Albrecht Penck, then in 1964 she was used for the first GDR expedition to the Atlantic.\\nAfter German reunification, the ship was demobilized by the dissolution of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR, which belonged to the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In 1992, the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research in Warnemünde was established. The ship, which spent around 200 days a year at sea, was now mainly used in the western Baltic Sea. She was equipped with a research winch and had four laboratories (wet, chemical, biotechnological and IT).\\nOn August 21, 2010, the vessel was decommissioned. The plan was to bring her to Stralsund and leave her at the Nautineum Stralsund museum for use. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern deviated from this plan and offered the ship for sale, believing that funding for the use of the museum was not secure. She was then acquired through a tendering process by the Krebs Group, which agreed in March 2011 to cooperate with the Stralsund Ozeaneum for the use of the vessel. Subsequently, the ship was to be used in winter for \"maritime education courses\" and \"research trips for student classes\". She would also be used as a working platform for offshore wind turbine maintenance teams. The Krebs Group, which bought the vessel in 2011, used her for work on offshore wind farms and for environmental monitoring.\\n\\n\\n== Acquisition by the humanitarian organization Sea-Eye ==\\nIn autumn 2018, the ship was sold to the non-governmental organization Sea-Eye, which uses her as a rescue boat for refugees and migrants in distress in the Mediterranean Sea.\\nOn 21 December 2018, she left the port of Algeciras for Libya. According to Sea-Eye, she was the first ship of a civilian relief organization to fly the German flag. On Sunday 10 February 2019, the father of the young Alan Kurdi named the ship in the presence of religious and political representatives, such as the Bishop of Mallorca Sebastià Taltavull i Anglada, in the port of Palma, on behalf of his drowned son.\\nOn 3 April 2019, the Alan Kurdi rescued 64 people from a dinghy off the Libyan coast after Libyan authorities responded to radio messages. Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini refused to disembark the population on the pretext that the ship was flying the German flag. Activists rejected the request to travel to Germany. Due to lack of food and clean water for the three to four week trip, the refugees were brought to Malta after an agreement was reached on 13 April  from where they were distributed to Germany, France, Portugal, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.\\nAt the beginning of July 2019, shortly after the start of a conflict between the rescue vessel Sea-Watch 3 and the Italian authorities, the crew decided to approach the search and rescue area located off the Libyan coast, with a Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung journalist on board. On 5 July 2019, 65 people were brought aboard the Alan Kurdi off the Libyan coast, from an inflatable boat. They came from twelve different countries, 48 from Somalia, 6 from Sudan, the others from Libya, Cameroon, South Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Benin, Benin, Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau. Without a GPS-enabled phone or other navigation aid, there was apparently only ten litres of potable water left on the dinghy, which had already been at sea for 12 hours. Alan Kurdi\\'s attempts to contact Libyan authorities as well as Italian rescue command centers were unsuccessful, according to Sea-Eye. The ship headed for Lampedusa and awaited in international waters off the Italian coast. After the Italian Ministry of the Interior had sent instructions, the vessel was refused entry to the port of Lampedusa. Alan Kurdi headed for Malta. With entry into the port of the island initially prohibited, the crew nevertheless hoped to obtain clearance to moor, in line with international aid commitments. On 7 July 2019, the ship was cleared to hand over all migrants to Maltese ships after the crew reported three medical emergencies on board.\\nShortly after the ship left the waters off Malta on 8 July 2019, the crew recovered 44 people traveling on a wooden boat. They came from Libya, Syria, Palestine and Pakistan. Again, the crew had to hand the migrants over to the Maltese Coast Guard. The crew then decided to initially end their operations in the Mediterranean. Despite that, on 4 August 2019 she disembarked 40 migrants in Malta.On April 6, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she rescued 150 migrants and headed for the Italian coast for them to be transferred to another boat which was quarantined with the support of the Red Cross.\\n\\n\\n== Change of ownership, 2021 ==\\nIn 2021, Sea-Eye acquired another ship, the Sea-Eye 4. The organisation then passed on the smaller Alan Kurdi, to the Spanish organisation Proem-Aid. In May 2021, the vessel had been released from detention in Olbia and was reported to be headed for Burriana for scheduled maintenance.In July 2021, the Italian humanitarian NGO, \\'RESQ (people saving people)\\' announced that they had acquired and were preparing to start operating the Alan Kurdi, now renamed RESQ PEOPLE. Sea-Eye had sold the Alan Kurdi for 400,000 Euros; during their time operating the boat, Sea-Eye claimed it had saved 927 lives.\\n\\n\\n== As RESQ PEOPLE ==\\nAfter an extensive overhaul, RESQ PEOPLE sailed from the port of Burriana on 7 August 2021 to start a first rescue mission.

He and his wife Ann (June 30, 1924 – June 10, 2004) produced hundreds of magazine articles, doodle pages and other resources still used in the leathercraft industry. A museum featuring much of his life\\'s work is part of a collection of leather art located in the lobby of the Tandy Leather Factory Headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.\\n\\n\\n== Al Stohlman ==\\nAl Stohlman was born in Olive, California. While young, he loved to draw and spend his spare time sketching animals of the Pacific Northwest. He hoped to one day become an illustrator of western books and magazines, like authors Zane Grey and Bret Harte. In 1939, Stohlman joined the 46th Engineer Regiment of the Army during World War II. There, he used his artistic interest to create sketches of his activities in the South Pacific. While serving in New Guinea, he saw locals creating decorative designs in leather and became curious about exploring the art.  He and a few friends used pocket knives to carve the leather and created rudimentary tools out of nails shaped into various forms.  They also used India ink to detail their work.After 40 months in the Army, Stohlman was discharged and returned to civilian life. He moved to Laguna Canyon where he settled in a shack that he made from an abandoned chicken coop. There, he took care of horses and began earning income through his leatherwork when he started purchasing plain saddles and decorating them to be sold at auction for a profit. He often got the inspiration for his designs by attending rodeos and sketching other designers\\' western artwork.His leather carving and stamping skills got him a job working for the SchaffLeather Company with Guy Lauderbach. Stohlman initially learned to make functional leather items beginning with suitcases and other simple projects until Lauderbach eventually taught him how to build and design saddles.  In 1952, Stohlman created a leather carving of a palomino wearing an ornate wooden saddle that attracted the attention of Dick McGahen, owner of the Craftool Company. McGahan hired Stohlman to design leatherworking tools and to write publications, earning national attention with his first book, \"How To Carve Leather\".  Working for Craftool Co. brought Stohlman to Los Angeles where he lived for 2 years before becoming a freelance artist and moving to a private ranch Hemet, California.In 1963, Al met and shortly after married Ann McDonald. The Stohlmans moved to Cache Creek, British Columbia in 1969, where they spent the next 29 years creating the bulk of their life\\'s work. The Stohlmans went on to publish a substantial catalog of texts about the fundamentals of leathercraft.When asked what goes into making a leather picture, Stohlman said: \"More than anything else, it takes ideas. And being a realist, I feel a picture or scene must be authentic in detail, so it takes time. Lots of time.\"The Al Stohlman Award for Achievement in Leathercraft is awarded annually to an artist whose accomplishments in leatherwork and dedication to the promotion of the craft follow the example set by Stohlman. Recipients of the medal are recognized on the basis of their overall achievements in leathercraft.\\n\\n\\n== Ann Stohlman ==\\nAnn Lloyd (June 30, 1924 - June 10, 2004) was born in Idaho, but grew up in north-eastern Oregon and north-eastern California. She was raised by her father, Jack Lloyd, and grew up in the logging camps he worked in. There, she learned to live in nature, fish, use fire weapons, and how to hunt.In the Spring of 1963, Ann was fishing trip in the Big Creek Lodge when she attended a leatherworking demonstration Al Stohlman was performing at the property. The two corresponded by mail and were married on August 20, 1963, in Tijuana, Mexico. Ann began learning the art of leatherwork by assisting her husband. Within 3 years, she learned the trade and was making saddles herself. Ann became quite an accomplished leatherworker, collaborating on many of Al\\'s books and having her work featured in a number of publications. In 1969, The Stohlmans moved from their property in Hemet, California to a 200-acre ranch in Cache Creek, British Columbia. Just as Al had taught Ann leathercraft, she taught him how to hunt and live off of the land, as she had in her youth.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nAl Stohlman (1982).

Managed by Jumeirah hotel group, it is one of the tallest hotels in the world, although 39% of its total height is made up of non-occupiable space. Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island that is 280 m (920 ft) from Jumeirah Beach and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. The shape of the structure is designed to resemble the sail of a ship. It has a helipad near the roof, at a height of 210 m (689 ft) above ground.\\n\\n\\n== Site ==\\nThe beachfront area where Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah Beach Hotel are located was previously called Chicago Beach. The hotel is located on an island of reclaimed land, 280 m (920 ft) offshore of the beach of the former Chicago Beach Hotel. The locale\\'s name had its origins in the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, which at one time welded giant floating oil storage tanks, known locally as Kazzans, on the site.\\n\\n\\n== Design and construction ==\\nThe Burj Al Arab was designed by the multidisciplinary consultancy Atkins, led by architect Tom Wright.  The design and construction were managed by Canadian engineer Rick Gregory, also of WS Atkins. Construction of the island began in 1994 and involved up to 2,000 construction workers during peak construction. It was built to resemble the billowing spinnaker sail of a J-class yacht. Two \"wings\" spread in a V to form a vast \"mast\", while the space between them is enclosed in a massive atrium.\\nThe hotel was built by South African construction contractor Murray & Roberts, now renamed Concor and Al Habtoor Engineering. The interior designs were led and created by Khuan Chew and John Coralan of KCA international and delivered by UAE based Depa Group.The building opened on 1 December 1999.The hotel\\'s helipad was designed by Irish architect Rebecca Gernon. The helipad is above the building\\'s 59th floor, and has been used as a car race track, a boxing ring, a tennis match, and the jumping off point for the highest kite surfing jump in history.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\nSeveral features of the hotel required complex engineering feats to achieve. The hotel rests on an artificial island constructed 280 m (920 ft) offshore. To secure a foundation, the builders drove 230 40-metre-long (130 ft) concrete piles into the sand.Engineers created a ground surface layer of large rocks, which is circled with a concrete honeycomb pattern, which serves to protect the foundation from erosion. It took three years to reclaim the land from the sea, while it took fewer than three years to construct the building itself. The building contains over 70,000 m3 (92,000 cu yd) of concrete and 9,000 tons of steel.Inside the building, the atrium is 180 m (590 ft) tall. The 18 storied atrium is enclosed by 12 individually tensioned two-layer membrane panels form the north facing façade.Given the height of the building, the Burj Al Arab is the world\\'s fifth tallest hotel after Gevora Hotel, JW Marriott Marquis Dubai, Four Seasons Place Kuala Lumpur and Rose and Rayhaan by Rotana. But where buildings with mixed use were stripped off the list, the Burj Al Arab would be the world\\'s third tallest hotel. The structure of the Rose Rayhaan, also in Dubai, is 333 metres (1,093 ft) tall, 12 m (39 ft) taller than the Burj Al Arab, which is 321 metres (1,053 ft) tall.\\n\\n\\n=== Rooms and suites ===\\nThe hotel is managed by the Jumeirah Group. Despite its size, the Burj Al Arab holds only 28 double-story floors which accommodate 202 bedroom suites. The smallest suite occupies an area of 169 m2 (1,820 sq ft), the largest covers 780 m2 (8,400 sq ft).Suites feature design details that juxtapose east and west. White columns show great influence. Bathrooms are accented by mosaic tile patterns.The Royal Suite, billed at US$24,000 per night, is listed at number 12 on World\\'s 15 most expensive hotel suites compiled by CNN Go in 2012.The Burj Al Arab is very popular with the Chinese market, which made up 25 percent of all bookings at the hotel in 2011 and 2012.\\n\\n\\n=== Services ===\\nThe hotel has a shuttle service with Rolls-Royces and a helicopter, and a private beach.\\n\\n\\n=== Restaurants ===\\n\\nThere are six restaurants in the hotel, including:\\nAl Muntaha (\"The Ultimate\"), is located 200 m (660 ft) above the Persian Gulf, offering a view of Dubai. It is supported by a full cantilever that extends 27 m (89 ft) from either side of the mast, and is accessed by a panoramic elevator.Al Mahara (\"Oyster\"), which is accessed via a simulated submarine voyage, features a large seawater aquarium, holding roughly 990,000 L (260,000 US gal) of water. The wall of the tank, made of acrylic glass in order to withstand the water pressure, is about 18 cm (7.1 in) thick.\\n\\n\\n=== Rating ===\\nThe Burj Al Arab is a five-star hotel, the highest official ranking. While the hotel is sometimes erroneously described as \"the world\\'s only \\'seven-star\\' hotel\", the hotel management claims never to have done that themselves. The term appeared due to a British journalist who had visited the hotel on a tour before the hotel was officially opened. The journalist described Burj al Arab as \"more than anything she has ever seen\" and therefore referred to it as a seven-star hotel. In the words of a Jumeirah Group spokesperson: \"There\\'s not a lot we can do to stop it. We\\'re not encouraging the use of the term. We\\'ve never used it in our advertising.\"\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Reviews by architecture critics ===\\nBurj Al Arab has attracted criticism as well\\n\"a contradiction of sorts, considering how well-designed and impressive the construction ultimately proves to be.\" The contradiction here seems to be related to the hotel\\'s decor.  \"This extraordinary investment in state-of-the-art construction technology stretches the limits of the ambitious urban imagination in an exercise that is largely due to the power of excessive wealth.\" Another critic includes negative critiques for the city of Dubai as well: \"both the hotel and the city, after all, are monuments to the triumph of money over practicality. Both elevate style over substance.\" Yet another: \"Emulating the quality of palatial interiors, in an expression of wealth for the mainstream, a theater of opulence is created in Burj Al Arab … The result is a baroque effect\".\\n\\n\\n== Notable events ==\\nSeveral events have taken place on the helipad 210 m (689 ft) above ground to attract media attention. These include:\\n\\n2004: Tiger Woods teeing off.\\n2005: Andre Agassi and Roger Federer playing tennis.\\n2006: Ronan Keating shot the Music Video for his single \"Iris\" at the Helipad of Burj Al Arab.\\n2007: The Today Show broadcast from the Helipad a segment of Where in the World is Matt Lauer?\\n2011: Golfer Rory McIlroy performing a bunker shot.\\n2013: Heli-lift of Aston Martin Vanquish.\\n2013: David Coulthard performing donuts in a Formula 1 racecar.\\n2017: Nick Jacobsen kiteboards down to the sea.\\n2021: David Guetta playing a DJ set on livestream.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nThe last chapter of the espionage novel Performance Anomalies takes place at the top of the Burj Al Arab, where the spy protagonist Cono 7Q discovers that through deadly betrayal his spy nemesis Katerina has maneuvered herself into the top echelon of the government of Kazakhstan. The hotel can also be seen in Syriana and also some Bollywood movies.Richard Hammond included the building in his television series, Richard Hammond\\'s Engineering Connections.\\nThe Burj Al Arab serves as the cover image for the 2009 album Ocean Eyes by Owl City.\\nThe Burj Al Arab was the site of the last task of the fifth episode of the first season of the Chinese edition of The Amazing Race, where teams had to clean up a room to the hotel\\'s standards.The building is featured in Matthew Reilly\\'s novel The Six Sacred Stones, where a kamikaze pilot crashes a plane into the hotel, destroying it in an attempt to kill the protagonist, Jack West Jr.\\nThe building was the location of the main challenge of the ninth episode of the Canadian-American animated television series Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race, where contestants were forced to either return a serve from a tennis robot on the hotel’s helipad, or squeegee an entire column of the hotel’s windows.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nW Barcelona (Hotel Vela) – skyscraper of similar appearance in Barcelona, Spain (sail)\\nOman TiT – residential skyscraper of similar appearance in Taipei, Taiwan (sail)\\nElite Plaza – a similar-shaped skyscraper in Yerevan, Armenia\\nJW Marriott Panama (Panama City) – similar structure\\nSpinnaker Tower, Portsmouth – similar structure in Portsmouth, UK\\nVasco da Gama Tower – a skyscraper of similar appearance in Lisbon, Portugal (sail)\\nList of tallest buildings in the United Arab Emirates\\nList of buildings in Dubai\\nList of tallest buildings in Dubai\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nRose, Steve (28 November 2005). \"Architecture: Sand and freedom\".

Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Daily Mirror published a story on its front page on 22 November 2005 that said the memo quotes Bush speculating about a US bombing raid on Al Jazeera\\'s world headquarters in the Qatari capital Doha and other locations. The story said that Blair persuaded Bush to take no action.\\n\\n\\n== Details of the memo ==\\nThe five-page memorandum is said by the Mirror to be a record of the meeting between the two leaders which took place on 16 April 2004 at the height of Operation Vigilant Resolve, an assault on Fallujah by U.S. Marines and Iraqi security forces. Al Jazeera reporters were in the city providing video footage of the conflict. The day before the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described Al Jazeera\\'s coverage as \"vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable.\" Al Jazeera reporters defended their live broadcasts of the civilian casualties by stating \"the pictures do not lie\".The White House dismissed the allegations made in the article.\\nGiven that Qatar is an ally of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Iraq War, many commentators speculated that even if the reports of the memorandum were accurate, they may simply have been recording a statement which the President did not intend to be taken seriously. A White House official told CNN \"We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response,\" and a Pentagon official called the Daily Mirror report \"absolutely absurd\".\\nA BBC News correspondent has suggested that if President Bush did indeed make the comments they were intended as \"some kind of joke.\"Writing in The Independent on 28 November Andreas Whittam Smith countered, observing that \"official note takers don\\'t normally record jokes\". He also pointed to the alleged leaker\\'s \"25 years\\' experience of tough postings in place such as Islamabad and Khartoum, ... often involved in intelligence work\" and concluded that he \"must have felt exceptionally troubled by what he was seeing.\"According to a report in The Daily Telegraph: \"People who have seen the document say the real reason that it is being suppressed by the Government is because it contains a potentially damaging private discussion between the two leaders about the controversial United States attack on the Iraqi city of Fallujah last year.\" The report also stated that, when questioned about the matter at the Commonwealth conference in Malta, Blair branded the claims a \"conspiracy theory.\"\\n\\n\\n== Official secrets and UK publication ban ==\\n\\nDavid Keogh, a civil servant at the Cabinet Office, and Leo O\\'Connor, a research assistant to former Labour MP Tony Clarke, were charged under the Official Secrets Act 1989 for the unauthorised disclosure of the memo (Keogh under section three, O\\'Connor under section five). When O\\'Connor gave the memo to Clarke, Clarke returned it to Downing Street. All news organisations in the United Kingdom have been warned by Attorney General Lord Goldsmith against further publication of information from the leaked memo; Goldsmith has mentioned the possibility of prosecution under section five of the Official Secrets Act 1989 if published details from the memorandum are considered to damage interests of the United Kingdom abroad. On 29 November 2005, Keogh and O\\'Connor appeared at Bow Street Magistrates Court in Central London. Following a 15-minute hearing the case was adjourned until 10 January 2006. On 10 May 2007, Keogh was found guilty on two counts of making a \"damaging disclosure\" by revealing the memo and was sentenced to 6 months in jail. He was also ordered to pay £5,000 in costs to the prosecution. O\\'Connor was sentenced to 3 months in jail.Boris Johnson, the (then) Conservative MP for Henley, editor of The Spectator and a supporter of the war, has stated that he will publish the memorandum if he receives a copy of it in the hope it will put speculation about what Bush may or may not have actually said to rest. Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, made a similar promise in an exchange with Johnson on the television show Have I Got News For You (broadcast on 25 November, but recorded the previous day).\\nThe trial judge in 2005 made an order under Section 11 of the Contempt Of Court Act 1981, banning in perpetuity any connection in the UK media between the trial and Al Jazeera. \"Any journalist will have to ensure in his own mind that they are not making an impermissible link\", he said. There have been no U.K. reports linking the trial and remarks by David Blunkett on Channel 4 stating that \"taking out\" Al-Jazeera was discussed in a conversation with Tony Blair at the start of the Iraq war.  Reporters Without Borders condemned the ban.In an appeal against the ban, lodged by a group of UK Media companies, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips partly lifted the ban. The UK media will now be able to repeat previously published allegations, but it will still be illegal to suggest that these allegations accurately represented evidence given in secret during the trial. It will also be illegal to print a particular phrase uttered in open court by Keogh when he was asked about the document.\\n\\n\\n== Previous U.S. bombings of Al Jazeera offices ==\\nAl Jazeera\\'s offices have previously been hit by United States weaponry. On 13 November 2001 a U.S. missile hit Al Jazeera\\'s office in Kabul, Afghanistan, during the U.S. invasion of that country. Although no Al Jazeera staff were hurt in the attack, the building was destroyed and some employees\\' homes were damaged. At the time, Mohammed Jasim al-Ali, managing editor, said that the coordinates of the office were well known to everyone including the Americans.When former British Home Secretary David Blunkett published his memoirs in late 2006, it was revealed he had advised Prime Minister Tony Blair in late March 2003 to bomb the Al Jazeera television transmitter in Baghdad. \"There wasn\\'t a worry from me because I believed that this was a war and in a war you wouldn\\'t allow the broadcast to continue taking place\", Blunkett said.On 8 April 2003 a U.S. missile hit an electricity generator at Al Jazeera\\'s office in Baghdad. The resulting fire killed reporter Tareq Ayyoub and wounded another staff member. On 24 February, Mohammed Jasim al-Ali had sent a letter with the coordinates of the offices to Victoria Clarke, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (the location had not been officially requested by the U.S. government). This incident, which occurred during the U.S. assault on Baghdad and after criticism of Al Jazeera\\'s coverage from those supportive of the war aims of the United States forces, gave rise to suspicions that the network had been targeted.\\nFrank Gaffney published an opinion piece on 29 September 2003 calling for Al Jazeera to be \"taken down\" \"one way or another\" because it constitutes \"enemy media\".\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nWallis, William; Khalaf, Roula (23 November 2005). \"Qatar shock at al-Jazeera bombing report\".

It provides extensive news coverage through 80 bureaus on a variety of media platforms in several languages, including Arabic and English. Al Jazeera has a large audience, but the organization (particularly its original Arabic channel) has been criticized for its  alleged involvement in controversies ranging from slanted journalism to anti-Israel bias.\\n\\n\\n== Allegations of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment ==\\n\\n\\n=== Antisemitism ===\\nAn article by Sherry Ricchiardi in the American Journalism Review (AJR) noted that critics of Al Jazeera have \"assailed what they see as anti-Semitic, anti-American bias in the channel\\'s news content.\" Ricchiardi had earlier criticized an Al Jazeera report that Jewish employees of 9/11 targets were informed of the attacks beforehand, a report which was also criticized in an October 2001 New York Times editorial. She cited the former Al Jazeera weekly show Sharia and Life, hosted by Yusuf Qaradawi (an Egyptian cleric who \"argues clearly and consistently that hatred of Israel and Jews is Islamically sanctioned\"). The organization held a 2008 on-air birthday party for Samir Kuntar, a Lebanese terrorist convicted of killing four Israelis who was released in July of that year, later admitting that its coverage of Kuntar\\'s release violated its code of ethics. The organization\\'s Beirut bureau chief said, \"Brother Samir, we wish to celebrate your birthday with you\" and called him a \"pan-Arab hero.\"Former Fox News commentator Bill O\\'Reilly has called Al Jazeera \"anti-Semitic\" and \"anti-American.\" Dave Marash, a veteran correspondent for ABC\\'s Nightline who resigned from his position as Washington anchor for Al Jazeera English in 2008 due to his perception of anti-American bias there, appeared on The O\\'Reilly Factor and said: \"They certainly aren\\'t anti-Semitic, but they are anti-Netanyahu and anti-Lieberman and anti-Israeli, right ...\"On May 30, 2017, Al Jazeera\\'s English-language account retweeted an Anti-Semitic meme. The network tweeted an apology after the incident, calling it a \"mistake.\"On May 20, 2019, AJ+ Arabic posted a video which was widely criticized as denying the holocaust.  It was pulled soon thereafter, amid backlash on social media, including from Al Jazeera\\'s own employees.\\n\\n\\n=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===\\nDue to Al Jazeera\\'s position as a major Middle Eastern news outlet, its editorial positions often receive increased scrutiny. During the Second Intifada, Palestinians killed by Israelis were referred to as \"martyrs\"; Israelis killed by Palestinians were not.Israel announced a \"boycott\" of the Arabic broadcaster on 13 March 2008, accusing it of bias in its coverage of the Gaza Strip conflict and toward Hamas. Israeli government employees declined interviews and denied visa applications for the organization\\'s staff. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Majalli Wahabi accused it of focusing on Palestinian suffering and ignoring that of Israel: \"We have seen that Al-Jazeera has become part of Hamas ... [sic] taking sides and cooperating with people who are enemies of the state of Israel.\" According to Israeli officials, Al-Jazeera covered the Gaza incursion but not Palestinian rocket attacks against the Israeli city of Ashkelon. Wahabi said that the Israeli Foreign Ministry would send letters of complaint to the organization and the Qatari government. Officials of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\\' Fatah party has accused Al-Jazeera of bias toward Hamas (with which it is at political loggerheads), and Fatah official Mohammed Dahlan sued the broadcaster. Al-Jazeera agreed to discuss its coverage of Mideast conflict, and the issue has apparently been settled.In February 2009, Israel again imposed sanctions on Al Jazeera after Qatar closed the Israeli trade office in Doha in protest against the Gaza War. Israel had considered declaring Al Jazeera a hostile entity and shutting its Israeli offices, but after a legal review the Israeli government decided to impose limited measures restricting the organization\\'s activities in the country. All Al Jazeera employees would not have their visas renewed, and the Israeli government would issue no new visas. Al Jazeera staff would not be allowed to attend government briefings; its access to government and military offices was reduced, and it could not interview Knesset members. The organization would only have access to three agencies: representatives of the Prime Minister\\'s Office, the Foreign Ministry, and the IDF Spokesperson\\'s Unit.On 15 July of that year, the Palestinian National Authority (PA) closed down Al Jazeera\\'s offices in the West Bank in an apparent response to claims made on the channel by Farouk Kaddoumi that PA president Mahmoud Abbas had been involved in the death of Yasser Arafat. The Palestinian Information Ministry called the organization\\'s coverage \"unbalanced\" and accused it of incitement against the PLO and the PA. Four days later, Abbas rescinded the ban and allowed Al Jazeera to resume operations.In August 2011, Afghan bureau chief Samer Allawi was arrested by Israeli authorities and charged with being a member of Hamas. Walied Al-Omary, Al Jazeera bureau chief in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said that a military court accused Allawi of making contact with members of Hamas\\' armed wing. The Committee to Protect Journalists Middle East and North Africa program coordinator Mohamed Abdel Dayem stated that \"Israel must clarify why it continues to hold Samer Allawi.\" Allawi was imprisoned for over a month and fined $1,400 after pleading guilty to meeting with Hamas, a militant group viewed as terrorist by Israel and most of the West. In 2013, UN researcher Nicola Perugini was accused by UN Watch of fabricating a United Nations Human Rights Council session in his Al Jazeera article about the latest UNHRC report on Israeli settlements.\\n\\n\\n== Alleged pro-Qatar bias ==\\nAl Jazeera was founded in 1996 as part of Qatari efforts to turn economic power into political influence in the Arab world and beyond, and continues to receive the staunch political and financial backing from the government of Qatar. As a result, Al Jazeera has been criticized for being Qatari state media. In 2010, U.S. State Department internal communications released by WikiLeaks as part of the 2010 diplomatic cables leak said that the Qatari government manipulates Al Jazeera coverage to suit the country\\'s political interests.\\nAl Jazeera has lost reporters and anchors in London, Paris, Moscow, Beirut and Cairo. Ali Hashem, the organization\\'s Shia Beirut correspondent, resigned after leaked emails publicized his discontent with Al Jazeera\\'s \"unprofessional\" and biased coverage of the Syrian civil war at the expense of the Bahraini protests of 2011. Since the Bahrain government was supported by the Gulf Cooperation Council (of which Qatar is a member), the protests were given less prominence than the Syrian conflict on the network. Longtime Berlin correspondent Aktham Suliman left in late 2012, saying that he felt he was no longer allowed to work as an independent journalist: Before the beginning of the Arab Spring, we were a voice for change, a platform for critics and political activists throughout the region. Now, Al-Jazeera has become a propaganda broadcaster... Al-Jazeera takes a clear position in every country from which it reports—not based on journalistic priorities, but rather on the interests of the Foreign Ministry of Qatar. In order to maintain my integrity as a reporter, I had to quit. \\nHe added, \"The news channel Al Jazeera was committed to the truth. Now it is bent. It\\'s about politics, not journalism. For the reporter that means: time to go ... The decline [in] 2004–2011 was insidious, subliminal, and very slow, but with a disastrous end.\"According to Walid Phares, Al Jazeera became the \"primary ideological and communication network\" for the Muslim Brotherhood during the 2011 Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Phares noted that after democratic forces had begun the rebellions, Al Jazeera played a \"tremendous role\" in supporting Islamist elements of the revolution.One of the organization\\'s largest resignations was that of 22 members of Al Jazeera\\'s Egyptian bureau. The group announced their resignation on 8 July 2013, citing biased coverage of Egyptian power redistribution favoring the Muslim Brotherhood.During the visit of the Qatari delegation to the 2017 UN General Assembly, anonymous critics commissioned what ostensibly appeared to be a news website, authoring a variety of articles calling Al Jazeera a \"state-run propaganda arm\", criticizing the Gulf state\\'s link to terror groups or to Iran, and promoting a dark view of the Qatari economy in response to the diplomatic crisis that year. The organization commissioned to launch this website was later identified as a conservative-leaning PR firm, Definers Public Affairs, which was also hired by Facebook to attack the social network\\'s opponents, including Apple, Google, and the philanthropist George Soros.\\n\\n\\n== Islamist position ==\\nWhile Al Jazeera was founded in 1996 as part of Qatari efforts to turn economic power into political influence in the Arab world and beyond; being that the government of Qatar itself was Islamist this included an Islamist element. However, over time this Islamic element grew stronger and damaged Qatar’s political relations with its neighboring states of Saudi Arabia and Egypt. According to Hugh Miles writing for the BBC, \"Al-Jazeera network remains the standard bearer for the Islamist position.\"\\n\\n\\n== Satellite disruption ==\\nDuring the 2010 FIFA World Cup opening game, Al Jazeera Sports\\' transmission to the Arab world went down without explanation in the first half; second-half transmission was patchy. Al Jazeera and FIFA said that they were working to figure out the cause of the disruption of Al Jazeera\\'s broadcast rights. According to a report in The Guardian, evidence indicated jamming by the Jordanian government.\\n\\n\\n== 2018 cricket pitch fixing exposé ==\\n\\nThe organization was instrumental in exposing pitch-fixing and -tampering controversies in Sri Lanka and India by covering pitch-fixing, primarily at Sri Lanka\\'s Galle International Stadium. The Al Jazeera documentary Cricket\\'s Match-Fixers revealed secret plans to fix the first match, scheduled at Galle during the November 2018 test series between England and Sri Lanka.According to Al Jazeera\\'s Investigative Unit, the groundsman at Galle helped bookmakers fix test matches at the stadium by changing the condition of the pitch. Al Jazeera reported that the last two test matches (Sri Lanka v Australia in 2016 and India v Sri Lanka in 2017) played at Galle were fixed by bookmakers who were seen bribing the groundsman at Galle. The report said that the bookmakers identified as suspects, including former Indian professional domestic cricketer Robin Morris, former Pakistani domestic cricketer Hasan Raza and former Sri Lankan cricketer Tharindu Mendis, were filmed secretly by an Al Jazeera reporter in the United Arab Emirates as they discussed past and future match-fixing.\\n\\n\\n== By country ==\\n\\n\\n=== Algeria ===\\nSeveral Algerian cities lost power on 27 January 1999, reportedly to keep residents from watching a program in which Algerian dissidents implicated the Algerian military in a series of massacres. On 4 July 2004, the Algerian government froze the activities of Al Jazeera\\'s Algerian correspondent. The official reason was that a reorganization of the work of foreign correspondents was in progress. According to Reporters Without Borders, however, the measure was a reprisal for a broadcast the previous week of another Al-Itijah al-Mouakiss debate on the political situation in Algeria.\\n\\n\\n=== Bangladesh ===\\nIn 2012, Al Jazeera faced criticism from Bangladeshi human rights activists and relatives of those killed in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. The news channel is often accused of downplaying the 1971 Bangladesh genocide, in which Islamist militias assisted the Pakistan Army in targeting Bengalis who sought independence from Pakistan. \\nIn response to the Al Jazeera Investigates documentary All the Prime Minister\\'s Men, the Government of Bangladesh described it as \"a misleading series of innuendos and insinuations in what is apparently a politically motivated “smear campaign” by notorious individuals associated with the Jamaat-i-Islami extremist group, which has been opposing the progressive and secular principles of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh since its very birth as an independent nation in 1971\". The foreign ministry stated that the Bangladeshi government \"regrets that Al Jazeera has allowed itself to become an instrument for their malicious political designs aimed at destabilizing the secular democratic Government of Bangladesh with a proven track record of extraordinary socio-economic development and progress\". The ministry also stated that \"the fact that the report’s historical account fails to even mention the horrific genocide in 1971 in which Jamaat perpetrators killed millions of Bengali civilians\" was \"one reflection of the political bias in Al Jazeera’s coverage\". The Bangladesh Army called the documentary a \"concocted and ill-intended report by a vested group in the news channel Al-Jazeera\", according to a statement by ISPR.Responding to allegations by Al Jazeera that Israeli surveillance equipment is used by Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Forces, United Nations spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said that UN agreements with Bangladesh on peacekeeping deployments did not include the \"operation of electronic equipment in the nature described by Al Jazeera in its documentary, and such equipment has not been deployed with Bangladeshi contingents in UN peacekeeping operations\". The UN called for an investigation into allegations of corruption among senior Bangladeshi officials.The Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists demanded a ban on Al Jazeera transmission within Bangladesh citing similar bans in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan and the UAE.Lamenting the censorship of Bangladeshi media, Mahfuz Anam, editor of The Daily Star, wrote \"Besides the government, the Al Jazeera report has also put us, the Bangladeshi media, on the dock, which is the main focus of my piece. Thousands of our readers want to know how come we are publishing the government and military\\'s condemnation of Al Jazeera without ever telling our readers what Al Jazeera said or reported. A normal journalistic practice, and one that we follow at The Daily Star, is that unless we carry the original story, in this case the Al Jazeera report, we do not publish any rejoinder, in this case the condemnatory statements of our foreign office and the military. They want to know, what prevented us from carrying the said report in the first place? If we were a free media today, we would have delved deeper into the widely-talked-about Al Jazeera report and analysed it, point by point, and exposed it for what it really is — not a top-class work of investigative journalism\".\\n\\n\\n=== Bahrain ===\\nBahrain Information Minister Nabeel bin Yaqub Al-Hamar banned Al Jazeera correspondents from reporting from inside the country on 10 May 2002, saying that the station was biased towards Israel and against Bahrain. After improvements in relations between Bahrain and Qatar in 2004, Al Jazeera correspondents returned to Bahrain. In 2010, however, the Information Ministry again banned Al Jazeera correspondents from reporting inside the country. The ministry accused the network of \"flouting [Bahrain\\'s] laws regulating the press and publishing\" after Al Jazeera aired a report on poverty in Bahrain.During his visit to Egypt in November 2011, Bahrain Centre for Human Rights president Nabeel Rajab criticized Al Jazeera\\'s coverage of the 2011 protests and said that it represents an Arabic double standard. Rajab said, \"Al Jazeera\\'s intentional ignoring  ... coverage of Bahrain protests makes me strongly believe that we need channels that are sponsored by people rather than by regimes.\" In the run-up to the Qatar diplomatic crisis, Bahrain blocked Al Jazeera within its borders.\\n\\n\\n=== Egypt ===\\n\\nAl Jazeera has faced considerable criticism and backlash in Egypt and other Arab countries; from ordinary people, media outlets, and governments who accuse it of supporting Qatari agenda and Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood Al Jazeera has been criticized by an Egyptian newspaper for its allegedly-biased coverage of news related to Egypt and its government. According to the Egypt Independent, many Egyptians believe Al Jazeera’s attacks to be a concerted effort by the channel to destroy Egypt’s image in the region.\"In 2010, Al Jazeera filed a lawsuit against the Egyptian Al-Ahram newspaper for \"Jazeerat al-Taharoush\" (\"Al Jazeera: An Island of Harassment\"), a 9 June 2010 article which Al Jazeera found \"wholly deceptive and journalistically unprofessional\" with an aim to \"damage the reputation of the Al Jazeera Network.\" The Egyptian regime later collapsed as a result of the Arab Spring.A Cairo court ordered Al Jazeera to stop broadcasting in Egypt in September 2013, saying that it was \"inciting violence that led to the deaths of Egyptians.\" On December 29 of that year, three journalists working for Al Jazeera English (Australian Peter Greste, Egyptian-Canadian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed) were taken into custody by Egyptian security forces at the Cairo Marriott Hotel. On June 23, 2014, after a four-month trial, they were found guilty of spreading false news and collaborating with the Muslim Brotherhood and sentenced to seven to 10 years\\' imprisonment. They were released on bail shortly afterwards, and Mohamed Fahmy sued Al Jazeera on 5 May 2015 for C$100 million (US$83m; £53m) in punitive and remedial damages for negligence and breach of contract. He accused the network of \"negligence\" by misinforming him about its legal status and their safety in Egypt. The three were pardoned on September 23, 2015, and released. Egypt blocked 21 websites, including Al-Jazeera and Masr AlArabiya, in May 2017, for allegedly supporting terrorism and spreading fake news by supporting the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.In 2021, Egyptian media criticized Al Jazeera for refusing to cover the protests against a controversial electoral law in Qatar which limited the voting rights of a Bedouin tribe. According to Ikram Badr al-Din, a professor of political science at Cairo University, this \"suggests that it is not independent and works only for the benefit of the ruling family in Qatar.”\\n\\n\\n=== India ===\\nColumnist Seema Sirohi has accused Al Jazeera of spreading an ignorant anti-India narrative in its coverage of the country. The Indian government banned the Al Jazeera TV channel in April 2015 for five days for repeatedly broadcasting disputed maps of India. According to the Surveyor General (SGI) had observed that in some of the maps displayed by Al Jazeera, \"a portion of the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir (i.e. PoK and Aksai Chin) has not been shown as a part of Indian territory\" on some Al Jazeera maps; Lakshadweep and the Andaman Islands were also not shown as Indian territories on some of the maps. In its reply to an order to show cause, Al Jazeera said that all its maps are generated by internationally known software used by Global News Providers.\\n\\n\\n=== Iraq ===\\nDuring the Iraq War, Al Jazeera and other news-gathering organizations experienced reporting and movement restrictions. Reporter Tayseer Allouni was expelled from the country and Diyar Al-Omari, another reporter, was stripped of his journalistic credentials by the US. On 2 April 2003, the organization announced that it would \"temporarily freeze all coverage\" of Iraq in protest of what Al Jazeera called unreasonable interference by Iraqi officials. Contrary to allegations, including those by Donald Rumsfeld on 4 June 2005, Al Jazeera has never shown beheadings; beheadings have appeared on a number of other websites, and have sometimes been misattributed to the organization. When the allegations were reported in other media, Al Jazeera pressed for retractions; The Guardian later corrected its report that the organization \"had shown videos of masked terrorists beheading western hostages\". The allegation was repeated on Fox News, however, when Al Jazeera\\'s English service was launched on 15 November 2006.The Iraqi Allawi government closed Al Jazeera\\'s Iraq office on 7 August 2004, calling the network responsible for a negative image of Iraq and charging it with fueling anti-Coalition hostilities. Al Jazeera spokesman Jihad Ballout said, \"It\\'s regrettable and we believe it\\'s not justifiable. This latest decision runs contrary to all the promises made by Iraqi authorities concerning freedom of expression and freedom of the press,\" and Al Jazeera vowed to continue reporting from inside Iraq. Photographs showed United States and Iraqi military personnel closing the office. The initial one-month shutdown was extended indefinitely in September 2004 and the offices were sealed, drawing condemnation from international journalists.In April 2013, Iraq banned Al Jazeera and nine other TV channels for \"sectarian bias\". In a statement, the Iraqi Communication and Media Commission said that the satellite channels had \"exaggerated things, given misinformation and called for breaking the law and attacking Iraqi security forces\". The commission noted a \"sectarian tone\" in the TV coverage and \"undisciplined media messages exceeded all reasonable limits\", threatening to \"jeopardize the democratic process\".\\n\\n\\n=== Israel ===\\nAl Jazeera TV covered welcome-home festivities for Samir Kuntar, a Lebanese terrorist imprisoned in Israel for killing several people in a Palestine Liberation Front raid from Lebanon into that country, on 19 July 2008. On the program, Al Jazeera Beirut office head Ghassan bin Jiddo called Kuntar a \"pan-Arab hero\" and organized a birthday party for him. Israel\\'s Government Press Office (GPO) announced a boycott of the channel, including a refusal by Israeli officials to be interviewed and a ban of its correspondents entering government offices in Jerusalem. Several days later, Al Jazeera director-general Wadah Khanfar issued a letter admitting that the program violated the channel\\'s code of ethics and saying that he ordered its programming director to take steps to ensure that such an incident would not recur.The channel was also criticized for allegedly-biased coverage of events in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, including the 2002 Bat Mitzvah massacre where the network omitted the facts that the victims were attending a bat mitzvah at a crowded banquet hall. When Palestinian militant Raed Karmi was killed by the Israeli Army, Al Jazeera was criticized for failing to provide sufficient context in its story.Israel again accused Al Jazeera of bias in 2008. Deputy Foreign Minister Majalli Wahabi accused the organization of focusing on Palestinian suffering and downplaying that of Israel, referring to Israeli residents of the western Negev who had been the target of rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip. \"We have seen that Al-Jazeera has become part of Hamas ... taking sides and cooperating with people who are enemies of the state of Israel,\" said Wahabi, a Druze. \"The moment a station like Al-Jazeera gives unreliable reports, represents only one side, and doesn\\'t present the positions of the other side, why should we cooperate?\" According to Israeli officials, Al Jazeera covered the Gaza incursion but not Palestinian rocket attacks on the Israeli city of Ashkelon. Wahabi said that the Israeli Foreign Ministry would send letters of complaint to the government of Qatar and Al Jazeera.In February 2015, Al Jazeera posted an article on its online edition alleging that the Israeli government had opened dams in its southern region to intentionally flood parts of the Gaza Strip. The article was replaced on 25 February with a statement that there were no dams in southern Israel and the original article was false. During the June 2017 Jerusalem attack, Israeli media accused Al-Jazeera of not identifying it as a terrorist attack and ignoring an attack by three Palestinians on the Temple Mount in Old Jerusalem (focusing instead on the killing of a Palestinian by Israeli forces during Friday prayers).\\n\\n\\n=== Kuwait ===\\nThe Al Jazeera office in Kuwait City was closed by government officials after the organization aired a story on police crackdowns. The story included interviews with members of the Kuwaiti opposition and a video of police beating activists. Four National Assembly members were injured in the crackdown. Kuwait\\'s Minister of Information described Al Jazeera\\'s coverage as \"intervention in a Kuwaiti domestic issue.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Libya ===\\nAccording to Libyan media, Al Jazeera worked on behalf of the Western world and the Gulf Cooperation Council to promote anti-Libyan policies and \"disseminate falsehoods and lies to incite international public opinion.\"\\nThe Emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani opposed the government of Libya and supported the 2011 Libyan Civil War. The emir ordered Al Jazeera to emphasize the Libyan conflict, contributing to the insurgency\\'s spread and influencing the Arab world\\'s view of Libya. Within a week of the start of the rebellion, Al Jazeera began using the rebels\\' tricolor flag to identify its coverage.The emir appeared on Al Jazeera, saying that military intervention in Libya was necessary, and the organization\\'s journalists were criticized for not challenging his position. The organization reported that Muammar Gaddafi was ordering troops to use rape as a weapon of war and issuing Viagra to his troops. Amnesty International investigated the claims and found them groundless.\\n\\n\\n=== Malaysia ===\\nAl Jazeera aired Locked Up in Malaysia\\'s Lockdown, a 101 East documentary alleging that the government of Malaysia mistreated illegal migrants and foreign workers during the country\\'s COVID-19 lockdown, on 3 July 2020. The documentary was called \"misleading\" and \"inaccurate\" by the Malaysian government; Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob demanded an apology from the organization for \"false reporting.\" The Royal Malaysia Police began an investigation of the documentary, and the Immigration Department sought to question the Al Jazeera journalists and a Bangladeshi migrant whom they interviewed. Several non-governmental organizations, including the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ), issued a statement defending Al Jazeera and calling on the Malaysian government to end its \"intimidatory measures\" against Al Jazeera and migrant workers.On 4 August, a team of Malaysian police officers and personnel from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission raided Al Jazeera\\'s office near the Petronas Towers and seized several devices as part of their investigation of the documentary. Al Jazeera English managing director Giles Trendle condemned the raid as a \"crackdown on media freedom\", and called on Malaysian authorities to end the criminal investigation of its journalists.\\n\\n\\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\\nSaudi Arabia banned Al-Jazeera and another Qatari website in early 2017 after Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said that he recognized Iran as an Islamic regional power and criticized Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump\\'s policy toward Iran. He praised the Lebanese organization Hezbollah and the Palestinian group Hamas. Qatar denied the allegations, saying that its QNA website had been hacked and it was investigating the incident.\\n\\n\\n=== Somalia ===\\nAl Jazeera aired The Toxic Truth, a two-part documentary on toxic waste dumped in Somalia, in January 2009. A Somali journalist who studied the documentary concluded that the organization failed to rigorously research the story. Another criticism of the documentary was that Al Jazeera did not allow former Somali interim president Ali Mahdi Muhammad to exercise his right of reply to accusations that he authorized Italy-based companies to dump in Somalia.\\n\\n\\n=== Spain ===\\nReporter Tayseer Allouni was arrested in Spain on 5 September 2003 and charged with providing support to members of al-Qaeda. Judge Baltasar Garzón, who issued the arrest warrant, ordered Allouni held without bail. Al Jazeera wrote to Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in protest: \"On several occasions, Western journalists met secretly with secret organizations and they were not subjected to any legal action because they were doing their job, so why is Allouni being excluded?\" Allouni was later released on bail for health reasons, but was prohibited from leaving the country.\\nOn 19 September, a Spanish court issued an arrest warrant for Allouni before the expected verdict. Allouni had asked the court for permission to attend his mother\\'s funeral in Syria, but authorities denied his request and ordered him back to jail.After pleading not guilty, Allouni was sentenced on 26 September 2005 to seven years in prison for being a financial courier for al-Qaeda. Allouni insisted that he merely interviewed Osama bin Laden after the 11 September 2001 attack on the United States. Al Jazeera has supported Allouni, insisting that he is innocent.Reporters Without Borders) condemned Allouni\\'s rearrest, and called on the Spanish court to free him. In January 2012, The European Court of Human Rights ruled on 17 January 2012 that the Spanish sentence was illegal, and Allouni was freed in March.\\n\\n\\n=== Sudan ===\\nIn May 2019, Sudan closed Al Jazeera\\'s office. Sudan summoned its envoy in Qatar for consultation the following month, saying that the envoy would soon return to Qatar. Qatar was seen as a close ally of ousted Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir.\\n\\n\\n=== Syria ===\\nAl Jazeera has been criticized for its coverage of the Syrian civil war, largely supporting the rebels and demonizing the Syrian government. The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir cited outtakes of interviews in which the channel\\'s staff coached Syrian eyewitnesses and fabricated reports of government oppression and leaked internal emails suggesting that the organization has become a tool of the Qatari emir\\'s foreign policy supporting Syria\\'s rebels and advocating military intervention in the country.Ahmad Ibrahim, in charge of Al Jazeera\\'s coverage of Syria, is the brother of a leading member of the rebel Syrian National Council. Al Jazeera reportedly pressured its journalists to use the term \"martyr\" for slain Syrian rebels, but not pro-government forces.A former Al Jazeera news editor from Syria who had worked at the organization for \"nearly a decade\" was fired without cause in January 2013. In an interview, they said that it was linked to their resistance to pressure to provide biased coverage of the civil war. The According to the editor, the Muslim Brotherhood was \"controlling the Syrian file at Al-Jazeera\"; both organizations slanted news coverage in favor of the Brotherhood ousting the Syrian government by force, and warned the then-editor that \"the majority [in Syria] is with the Muslim Brotherhood and [taking power] is within our grasp ... thank your god if you get a pardon when we become the government.\" The source named several other employees who resigned in protest, including Berlin bureau director Aktham Sleiman (a Syrian \"who was, in the beginning, with the [Syrian] opposition\" but resisted what the editor called the \"lies and despicable [political and ethnic] sectarianism\"). \"Al-Jazeera has lied and is still lying\" about Syria, favoring armed insurrection and the Muslim Brotherhood.\\n\\n\\n=== Tunisia ===\\nIn midst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Al Jazeera retracted an article which accused Tunisia of \"internalised Islamophobia\" for closing the country’s mosques to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019.\\n\\n\\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\\nIn 2015, Al Jazeera was condemned by UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash for twisting a statement by UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan about the Russian Sukhoi Su-24 downed by Turkey. During a press conference with a Russian official in Abu Dhabi, Al Nahyan said that the UAE \"offers its deepest condolences to our Russian friends on the incident of the military plane that crashed recently in Syria\" and called the crash of a Russian civilian plane in Egypt \"a terrorist act.\" Al Jazeera reported that he \"describes the Turkish shooting of the Russian fight jet a terrorist act,\" which Gargash said ignored the fact that he was referring to the Russian passenger plane which crashed in Egypt. The Al Jazeera statement was reported more than once, and was tweeted by the channel on its main Twitter account. According to Gargash, \"The way Al Jazeera channel has dealt with the statement of Shaikh Abdullah Bin Zayed was not a professional blunder; It was part of a smear campaign [by the media] against the UAE.\"The UAE blocked Al Jazeera in the emirates on 5 June 2017 (after the onset of the Qatar diplomatic crisis) because the organization was a state-endowed entity of the Qatari government and Qatar is \"a major sponsor of hate speech through Al Jazeera’s Arabic-language network and its other state-controlled media entities.\" In the International Court of Justice case filed by Qatar against the United Arab Emirates about the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination (Qatar v. United Arab Emirates), Qatar requested that the court order the UAE to suspend its block of Al Jazeera. The court ruled, \"both parties shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute\\nbefore the court or make it more difficult to resolve.\"In June 2017, hacked emails from UAE ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba were reported as \"embarrassing\" by HuffPost because they indicated links between the UAE and the US-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. According to a number of observers, the extensive media coverage of the alleged email hack was seen as exacerbatiing the Qatar diplomatic crisis and orchestrated by Qatar.After the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis and in 2018, Al Jazeera reported apparent new details about a 1996 Qatari coup d\\'état attempt which accused the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt of plotting to overthrow Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. According to the organization, former French National Gendarmerie commander Paul Barril was contracted and supplied with weapons by the UAE to carry out the coup in Qatar. UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said that Barril was a security guard for Qatari emir Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani during the emir\\'s visit to Abu Dhabi; had no connection to the UAE, and the report was an attempt to involve the UAE in the coup attempt.In 2019, Al Jazeera Arabic tweeted that a photograph of a Buddhist sculpture in Abu Dhabi which was part of a Louvre Abu Dhabi cultural initiative led to \"commentators saying there is a return of idol worship to the Arabian Peninsula.\" The National called the insinuation that the sculpture contradicted Islam fake news.\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\nUK officials, like their US counterparts, protested against Al Jazeera\\'s coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. According to the organization, coalition leaders objected because its reporting made it more difficult for both countries to manage the reporting of the war.Several pro-Israel British activists and a former Israeli embassy employee filed complaints with UK media regulator Ofcom in 2017 that The Lobby, an Al Jazeera four-part documentary series, was antisemitic. The complaints also accused the organization of bias, unfair editing, and infringement of privacy, because The Lobby used hidden cameras and undercover journalism to investigate alleged efforts by Israeli diplomats and UK pro-Israel advocacy groups to influence British foreign policy to favor Israel. On 9 October 2017, Ofcom issued a 60-page ruling rejecting the complaints which was welcomed by an Al Jazeera source as vindicating the organization\\'s journalism.\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\nSince the September 11 attacks, US officials have accused Al Jazeera\\'s news coverage of anti-American bias. The organization first received widespread attention in the West after 9/11, when it broadcast videos in which Osama bin Laden and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith defended the attacks. This led to accusations by the United States government that Al Jazeera was broadcasting propaganda on behalf of terrorists. The organization countered that it was making information available without comment, and several Western television channels later broadcast portions of the tapes. At a 3 October 2001 press conference, Colin Powell tried to persuade the emir of Qatar to close Al Jazeera.On 13 November 2001, during the war in Afghanistan, a US missile destroyed Al Jazeera\\'s office in Kabul. There were no casualties.\\nWhen Al Jazeera reported events with graphic footage from inside Iraq, the organization was described as anti-American and inciting violence because it reported on issues of national security. In 2003, Washington bureau chief Hafez al-Mirazi resigned to protest the organization\\'s \"Islamist drift.\"On 24 March 2003, two Al Jazeera reporters covering the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had their credentials revoked. The NYSE banned Al Jazeera and several other undisclosed news organizations from its trading floor indefinitely. According to NYSE spokesman Ray Pellechia, the ban was for \"security reasons\" and the exchange had decided to allow access only to networks focusing \"on responsible business coverage\". Pellechia denied that the revocation of credentials was connected to Al Jazeera\\'s Iraq War coverage. However, NYSE executive vice president for communications Robert Zito indicated that Al Jazeera\\'s 22 March 2003 broadcast of US POWs and dead American soldiers led him to ban the organization. The move was quickly mirrored by NASDAQ stock-market officials. The NYSE ban was lifted several months later. Akamai Technologies, a US company whose founder was killed in the 11 September World Trade Center attacks, canceled a contract to provide web services for Al Jazeera\\'s English-language website.On 12 October 2008, Al Jazeera broadcast interviews with attendees of a Sarah Palin rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio. The interviewees made racist remarks about Barack Obama, such as \"he regards white people as trash\" and \"I\\'m afraid if he wins, the blacks will take over\". The report received over 2 million views on YouTube and, according to Colin Powell, \"Those kind of images going out on Al Jazeera are killing us.\" The Washington Post then ran an op-ed saying that Al Jazeera was deliberately encouraging \"anti-American sentiment overseas\". The organization called the column \"a gratuitous and uninformed shot at Al Jazeera\\'s motives\", and its report was only one of \"hundreds of hours of diverse coverage.\"Al Jazeera has reportedly censored criticism of the United States in response to US pressure. Al Jazeera English director Wadah Khanfar resigned in September 2011 after WikiLeaks documents asserted that he had close ties to the US and agreed to remove content if Washington objected.In 2014, Al Jazeera retracted an article which claimed that the murders of two US journalists (James Foley and Steven Sotloff) by Islamic State were staged by the US as an excuse for attacking ISIS.On 28 April 2015, Al Jazeera America supervisor of media and archive management Matthew Luke filed a US$15 million lawsuit against the organization for unfair dismissal. Luke alleged that he had been unfairly dismissed after he had raised concerns with Al Jazeera\\'s human-resource division that senior vice-president of broadcast operations and technology Osman Mahmud (his boss) discriminated against female employees and made antisemitic remarks. Al Jazeera America head Ehab Al Shihabi announced that the organization would contest the lawsuit in court. Mahmud denied Luke\\'s charges, calling him a difficult employee. In an unrelated development, two female Al Jazeera America employees (executive vice-president for human resources Diana Lee and executive vice-president for communications Dawn Bridges) had resigned that week. On 4 May, senior Al Jazeera America executive and former CBS news anchor Marcy McGinnis resigned from the organization for undisclosed reasons. The following day, Al Jazeera Media Network demoted Al Shihabi from CEO to chief operations officer (COO) of Al Jazeera America after The New York Times reported that he had attempted to fire and sue popular host Ali Velshi. Shihabi was replaced by former Al Jazeera English managing director Al Anstey. Anstey announced on 13 January 2016 that Al Jazeera America would cease operations in April; the \"decision by Al Jazeera America’s board is driven by the fact that our business model is simply not sustainable in light of the economic challenges in the U.S. media marketplace\".\\n\\n\\n== Death of Tareq Ayyoub ==\\nAl Jazeera\\'s Baghdad office was hit by a missile fired by an American ground-attack aircraft on 8 April 2003, killing reporter Tareq Ayyoub and wounding another person. Al Jazeera reported that it had mailed the coordinates of its office to the US State Department six weeks earlier. Dima Tareq Tahboub, Ayyoub\\'s widow, denounced her husband\\'s death; she has written for The Guardian and participated in an Al Jazeera English documentary. The New York Times reported on 30 January 2005 that the Qatari government, under pressure from the Bush administration, was planning to sell Al Jazeera.\\n\\n\\n== Bombing memo ==\\n\\nThe UK tabloid Daily Mirror reported on 22 November 2005 that it had obtained a leaked memo from 10 Downing Street that US President George W. Bush had considered bombing Al Jazeera\\'s Doha headquarters in April 2004, when United States Marines were conducting a contentious assault on Fallujah.\\n\\n\\n== Omar Abdel-Rahman ==\\nOren Kessler accused Al Jazeera of defending Omar Abdel-Rahman for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Arabs and Westerners received differing messages from news organizations in the Gulf states. Al Jazeera reportedly praised Abdel-Rahman, saying that he \"defended human rights\" and \"rejected tyranny\".\\n\\n\\n== Detention of Sami al-Hajj ==\\nAl Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj, a Sudanese national, was detained en route to Afghanistan in December 2001 and held without charge as an enemy combatant in Camp Delta of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp until May 2008. The reasons for his detention remain unknown, although the official US position on all detainees is that they are security threats. Reporters Without Borders repeatedly expressed concern about al-Hajj\\'s detention, mentioning him in its annual Press Freedom Index and circulating a petition for his release.Clive Stafford Smith, al-Hajj\\'s lawyer, reported on 23 November 2005 that US officials had asked his client in 125 of 130 interviews if Al Jazeera was a front for al-Qaeda. After his release, al-Hajj expressed plans to sue US President George W. Bush for his treatment at Guantanamo. According to Stafford Smith, his accusations include beatings and sexual assault.Al-Hajj was released on 1 May 2008 from Guantanamo Bay and flown to Sudan, arriving in Khartoum on a US military plane early on 2 May. Al Jazeera broadcast video in which he was carried into a hospital on a stretcher, looking frail but smiling and surrounded by well-wishers.\\n\\n\\n== The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers ==\\nAl Jazeera English and Al Jazeera America broadcast \"The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers\", an episode of Al Jazeera Investigates examining professional athletes\\' possible use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), on 27 December 2015. Peyton Manning and other prominent athletes were identified as having received drugs from Charles Sly, a pharmacist who had worked at the Guyer Anti-Aging Clinic in Indianapolis in the fall of 2011.The Huffington Post leaked the episode a day before Al Jazeera\\'s broadcast. In a Sunday NFL Countdown interview with ESPN\\'s Lisa Salters on the morning of 27 December, Manning called the documentary \"completely fabricated\" and \"garbage\" and expressed anger about his wife was mentioned. When Salters noted that other athletes had first denied and then admitted allegations, Manning said that he could not speak for others. He said that he had visited the Guyer clinic 35 times in 2011 and received medication and treatment.Sly recanted his story and requested that the report not be aired via a YouTube video. Although Sly later said that he had never seen the Mannings and told ESPN\\'s Chris Mortensen that he is not a pharmacist and was not at the Guyer institute in 2011 (as Al Jazeera reported), state licensing records indicate that a Charles David Sly was licensed as a pharmacy intern in Indiana from April 2010 to 1 May 2013.Manning hired former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer to manage the issue, and threatened to sue Al Jazeera. On 5 January 2016, it was announced that Ryan Howard and Ryan Zimmerman were suing Al Jazeera for defamation after the documentary aired. In January 2021 attorneys for Al Jazeera Media presented sealed evidence in court, which they said supported their original report.\\n\\n\\n== The Lobby ==\\nJournalist Armin Rosen of the American Jewish magazine Tablet published an article on 20 January 2017 saying that pro-Palestinian filmmaker and undercover Al Jazeera reporter James Anthony Kleinfeld had infiltrated several pro-Israel advocacy organizations in Washington, D.C., including StandWithUs, the Israel Project, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Israel on Campus Coalition, and the Zionist Organization of America\\'s (ZOA) Fuel For Truth. According to the article, Kleinfeld had also infiltrated pro-Israel organizations and circles in the United Kingdom (the subject of an Al Jazeera documentary that month). As an undercover journalist, Kleinfield had reportedly obtained work at several pro-Israel organizations, interviewed dozens of Jewish pro-Israel activists, had access to donors, hosted Israeli embassy officials at his home, and filmed dozens of hours of video. Kleinfield left Washington suddenly in January 2017, around the time that Al Jazeera broadcast The Lobby: a four-part documentary series which used undercover journalism to infiltrate several pro-Israel advocacy groups in the United Kingdom.On 11 October 2017, Al Jazeera admitted that it had installed an undercover journalist in several Washington-based pro-Israel organizations the previous year and was planning to air a documentary film based on the reporter\\'s work. The announcement followed a ruling by the British media regulator Ofcom which rejected complaints about The Lobby; the documentary led to the resignation of an Israeli diplomat and sparked accusations of antisemitism from UK pro-Israel advocacy groups and representatives of the Jewish community. Clayton Swisher, Al Jazeera\\'s director of investigative reporting, acknowledged that the network had stationed an undercover journalist in the UK and the US at the same time.On 8 February 2018, it was reported that Qatari leaders had reassured the leaders of American Jewish organizations that Al Jazeera would not air its companion documentary series on the Israel lobby in the United States. According to Haaretz, the Qatari government had hired Republican Senator Ted Cruz\\'s former aide Nicolas Muzin to open communications channels with Jewish American organizations. Al Jazeera had earlier sent letters to several American pro-Israel organizations informing them that their employees would appear in the documentary. The letters generated speculation that the Qatari government had reneged on its promise to prevent Al Jazeera from screening the documentary, which (like the British series) had used clandestine footage and recordings of pro-Israel activists.Al Jazeera\\'s decision not to screen the documentary was criticized by Swisher, who defended the investigation unit\\'s use of undercover journalism, accused the organization of bowing to outside pressure, and took a sabbatical to express his displeasure. In March, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers which included Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer, Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin, and Ted Cruz wrote a letter urging United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate whether Al Jazeera should register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They also urged the Justice Department to investigate reports that the organization had infiltrated nonprofit organizations and accused Al Jazeera of broadcasting \"anti-American, anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel\" content.The Zionist Organization of America said on 10 April 2018 that Morton Klein, its president, lobbied the Qatari government not to screen the companion documentary series focusing on the American pro-Israel lobby. Portions of the series were leaked in late August and early September by several outlets, including the Electronic Intifada. The Electronic Intifada, French media outlet Orient XXI and Lebanon\\'s Al Akhbar newspaper released the four episodes of The Lobby—USA in early November.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBBC controversies\\nCBS News controversies and criticism\\nCNN controversies\\nFox News controversies\\nMSNBC controversies\\nList of controversies involving The New York Times\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nElhady, Emad (Mar 22, 2018). \"The Western Media Misguided Narrative about Al Jazeera\".

The primary example is the effect\\'s namesake – the impact of the Al Jazeera Media Network on the politics of the Arab world.\\n\\n\\n== Origin and use ==\\nAl Jazeera was created in 1996 with the combination of the Emir of Qatar\\'s money and talent from the defunct BBC Arabic service. It started as a response to the strict control that many governments in Arab League countries exercised over most forms of journalism as well as the lack of a free press. Audiences and journalists alike were drawn to Al Jazeera’s goal of reporting news without government censorship, as well as its recruitment of expert journalists who covered multiple perspectives on a singular issue. At the time, the viewing public did not respect journalism because it considered most reporters to be mouthpieces for dictators or political groups. The Emir of Qatar sought to break the heavy handed media management by the government because he had progressive ideas of expanding political participation and allowing independent press.Similarly, founders set up Al Jazeera to counter the dominant Western viewpoint of Arabs and Arabic culture throughout the 20th century. Arabs depended on the BBC and CNN International – but were frustrated they had to listen to the Western viewpoints about themselves. William Lafi Youmans attributes the first use of the term to Philip Seib, author of The Al Jazeera Effect: How the New Global Media Are Reshaping World Politics (2008). However, Simon Henderson, who in turn attributes the term to \"diplomats in the region\", had used it as early as 2000. As used by Henderson, the Al Jazeera effect originally referred to Arab Middle East governments losing their monopoly on information because of the popularity and easy access to the Al Jazeera satellite television media network, and scholars still often use it in such a limited context. Thomas L. McPhail used it to refer to the changes in all of the Arab media. Seib generalized it to other, Internet-powered new media worldwide.Al Jazeera challenges authoritarian governments by stimulating discussion on topics and through its provision of multiple perspectives and opinions. Al Jazeera\\'s motto is \"The Opinion and the Other Opinion\", demonstrating its dedication to covering multiple perspectives rather than taking one stand on an issue.  It also takes the position in reporting as the “voice of the voiceless” rather than relying solely on official statements from officials and other figures of power. Al Jazeera was not the first Arab satellite channel, but it did provide new standards and production values in Arab news media. \\n\\n\\n== Impact ==\\nAl Jazeera ended the flow of information that followed the format of from the \"West to the rest\". Al Jazeera has focused on reporting news stories originating from underrepresented countries, countering the one-way flow of media information from the global north to the global south.  Egyptian dissident Saad al-Din Ibrahim spoke of Al-Jazeera as giving Arab citizens open public space and new opportunities for expression and assertion, which has been seen through its on-air talk shows, discussion, and phone-in programs. Various critics have acknowledged Al Jazeera’s role in aiding reforms during the 2005 Arab Spring, specifically in regards to its news coverage of Iraqi elections and Lebanese protests. Additionally, Al Jazeera created a voting system in which viewers could vote online, formulating a type of democracy via satellite system. This has been a useful tool in measuring public opinion, especially on controversial topics, in the Arab world.  As a result of Al Jazeera\\'s programs, individuals in the Middle East have learned more about Western democracy and politics than from other previous sources. The Al Jazeera effect follows a similar pattern to the CNN effect and includes the accelerant effect, impediment effect, and agenda-setting effect. Seib noted that the Al Jazeera effect can be seen as parallel to the CNN effect, which states that coverage of international events can force otherwise uninvolved governments to take action. Whereas the CNN effect is used in the context of mainstream, traditional media networks such as CNN, the Al Jazeera effect generalizes this to newer media such as citizen journalist blogs, internet radio, and satellite broadcasting. He also argues that new media strengthen the identity of and give voice to previously marginalized groups, which previously lacked their own media outlets; he cites the Kurdish people as an example. Many of the new media organizations are affiliated with such groups, social movements or similar organizations. New media weaken the monopoly of many states on information, as even extensive Internet censorship in countries such as China is not wholly effective. He concludes that the new media, while not beyond being abused, are largely contributing to democratization and political reform worldwide. William Lafi Youmans notes that Seib\\'s prediction that the Al Jazeera effect will lead to changes in the politics of the Middle East was realized in the early 2010s during the Arab Spring, with new media provoking widespread debate and unrest within the region. The CNN effect and Al Jazeera effect have had a tremendous impact on policies and the government. They have both influenced foreign policies of the US. the existence of such news organizations is crucial for having global communications and is promising in terms of spreading democracy.\\n\\n\\n== Subaltern ==\\nThe Al Jazeera effect has also been referred to as a subaltern, in reference to subaltern (post colonialism). Subaltern, depending on the context and where the subaltern is present, resembles something of opposition to the status quo through the demographic that does not have the capital to have their voices be heard; this form of alternative media gives a \"voice to the voiceless\". This notion of the subaltern is discussed by scholars, such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nSlashdot effect\\nVoice of the Arabs\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nHudson, Michael C.

The anti-shock body is closely associated with the area rule, a recent innovation of the era to minimise wave drag by having a cross-sectional area which changes smoothly along the length of the aircraft. The extension beyond the trailing edge was considered secondary to the body on the wing surface which slowed the supersonic flow to give a weaker shock and acted as a fence to prevent outward flow. The extension was only long enough to prevent flow separation.\\nWhitcomb stated that the anti-shock body was no longer required on the top surface of a wing when the supercritical airfoil was introduced because they both decreased the strength of, or eliminated, the shock and its attendant drag.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nAircraft that have used anti-shock bodies are the Convair 990 airliner and Fokker 100 aircraft.So-called \"Küchemann carrots\" were added to the Handley Page Victor to provide volume for carrying chaff. They did not improve the performance of the aircraft and when they became redundant for their intended purpose they were left in place to save the cost of removing them.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Alternatives ==\\nBoeing 747 have wing twist at the wing section outside the outboard engines to offset shockwaves on the upper surface, this is introduced by Joe Sutter.\\nModern jet aircraft use supercritical airfoils to minimize drag from shockwaves on the upper surface.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Bibliography ===\\n'], ['Association_of_Space_Explorers', 'Astronauts', \"The Association of Space Explorers is a non-profit organization with a membership composed of people who have completed at least one Earth orbit in space (above 100 km (62 mi), as defined by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.

The rectory was completed in 1770 and was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency on 1 October 1993. Since completion the rectory has been the home and workspace of the Astrup Church priest and is owned by the Church of Denmark along with the church itself.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn 1767 Christen Begtrup from Odder was assigned the Astrup Church pastorate and he commenced a large renovation project of the church and rectory. The church had a bell tower added in 1780 and east of the choir a sacristy was constructed. The main effort was directed at the rectory which was completely rebuilt and completed in 1770. The following years a number of buildings was added to the main building. In 1777 a barn and was added, in 1784 a smokehouse and in 1806 a wing for tenant housing. All these additions have since been torn down or burnt, leaving only the original main building.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture ==\\n\\nThe rectory is a 44 meters long half-timbered brick building with a ridged roof tiled with red brick. The building has a large dormer window in the middle on each side of the building, facing north and south. The building originally had a traditional interior design with a hallway on the north side, running along the length of the building, while the south side was occupied by evenly sized rooms with doors aligned to make it possible to see through them, from one end of the building to the other. In the west end of the building a single large room cut the hallway short to make a, for the time, uncharacteristically large room which was likely used as a small dance or concert hall.The building has been renovated and altered from its original design a number of times. In the late 1700s a living room was expanded across the width of the building which cut the hallway off. In 1856 the rectory was extensively renovated with new floors, interior walls of brick instead of wood, new support beams for the ceilings and new, flat roofs on the dormer windows.The building has since been renovated in 1915, 1924, 1962 and 1990. In the 1924 the roofs of the dormer windows were restored to their original ridged state. The renovation in 1915 was done by Christian Kampmann for which he received the C. F. Hansen Medal in 1918.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\"Fredede Bygninger Marts 2018\" [Listed Buildings March 2018] (PDF) (in Danish). Slots- og Kulturstyrelsen.

Atmospheric theatres were designed and decorated to evoke the feeling of a particular time and place for patrons, through the use of projectors, architectural elements and ornamentation that evoked a sense of being outdoors. This was intended to make the patron a more active participant in the setting.The most successful promoter of the style was John Eberson. He credited the Hoblitzelle Majestic Theatre (Houston, 1923) as the first. Before the end of the 1920s he designed around 100 atmospheric theatres in the U.S. and a few other countries, personally selecting the furnishings and art objects.\\n\\n\\n== Atmospheric theatres in the United States ==\\n\\n\\n=== Designed by John Eberson ===\\nJohn Eberson was the most successful promoter and designer of the atmospheric style. The following seventeen of his atmospheric theatres in the United States are still in operation. 2015 the Loew\\'s 46th Street Theatre, part of Loews Cineplex Entertainment, build 1927 by Universal Pictures, 2400 seats, Wurlitzer Theatre organ, Brooklyn, 4515 New Utrecht Avenue  has been razed. Marcus Loew (1870-1927) was a pioneer in the film industry and founder of\\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Due to the economic circumstances of his family, he had to work early and leave school at the age of nine. In 1920 he bought Metro Pictures Corporation and in 1924 Goldwyn Picture Corporation and merged them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).\\n\\nNew Regal Theater (originally Avalon Theater) (Chicago)Moorish Revival\\n\\nAkron Civic Theatre (Akron, Ohio)The theater was built in 1929 by Marcus Loew and designed by theater architect John Eberson. It opened as Loew\\'s (Akron) Theatre and seats 5,000 people. The auditorium is designed to resemble a night in a Moorish garden. Twinkling stars and drifting clouds travel across the domed ceiling. Located on Akron\\'s South Main Street, the theater\\'s entrance lobby extends over the Ohio and Erie Canal. The theater has a small multicolored terra cotta façade dominated by a large marquee. The interior of the entrance and lobby is designed to resemble a Moorish castle with Mediterranean decor, complete with medieval-style carvings, authentic European antiques and Italian alabaster sculptures. A grand full-sized Wurlitzer organ hidden beneath the stage rises to the stage level on a special elevator. In June 2001, the Akron Civic Theatre closed its doors for the most expensive and extensive renovation in its history in order to bring the theater up to modern performance and patron standards, and to restoring its failing 75-year-old infrastructure. The renovation cost just over $19 million, which included additional restroom facilities, new concession stands and expansion of the lobbies. The renovation allowed for the Civic to better serve customers with special needs by adding more handicapped seating and a new elevator. To bring the theatre up to new standards the dressing rooms were all redone and the stage was expanded from twenty-six feet to forty feet. Also added to the Civic was a freight elevator, a new loading dock and a cross-over space behind the stage\\'s back wall. Other improvements included updating the sound system, HVAC, roof exterior, electrical service and modernizing the plumbing. The newly renovated Civic Theatre re-opened in November 2002.\\n\\nIndiana Theatre (Terre Haute, Indiana)The Indiana Theatre has a Spanish courtyard design and was one of the first Eberson theatres to exhibit atmospheric elements. While not fully atmospheric, the Indiana Theatre\\'s original lighting system gave a blue hue to the auditorium ceiling and scattered light to simulate stars. The tile and terrazzo flooring, shapes of windows, prominence of Spanish coats of arms, Churrigueresque exterior, as well as numerous plaster designs that were seen first in the Indiana Theatre became a framework for later designs. Eberson stated, \"Into this Indiana Theatre I have put my very best efforts and endeavors in the art of designing a modern theatre such as I have often pictured as what I would do were I given a free hand.\"\\nMajestic Theatre (Dallas, Texas)Renaissance Revival.

Originally built with over 900 seats, the theatre was divided into two levels and was most recently renovated as cabaret-style theatre.  Lafflines Comedy Club and Amicus Performing Arts Club operate this heritage theatre.\\n\\nCapitol Theatre (Port Hope, Ontario, Canada)The Capitol Theatre is located in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada, and is one of the last three atmospheric movie theatres still in operation in Canada. Constructed in 1930, the interior of the auditorium was designed to resemble a walled medieval courtyard surrounded by a forest. It was also one of the first cinemas in Canada built expressly for talking pictures. It opened on Friday, August 15, 1930, with the film \"Queen High\" starring Charles Ruggles and Ginger Rogers.\\n\\nCapitol Theatre (Haymarket, New South Wales, Australia)The Capitol Theatre is located in Haymarket, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia and is the only atmospheric theatre to survive substantially intact in Australia.\\n\\nLe Grand Rex (Paris, France)Le Grand Rex is the largest cinema, theater and music venue in Paris, with 2,800 seats. Opened in 1932, the cinema features a starred \"sky\" overhead, as well as interior fountains, and resembles a Mediterranean courtyard at night. The cinema features one of the largest screens in Europe. Atmospheric theatre pioneer John Eberson assisted architect Auguste Bluysen with the project.\\n\\nLido Theatre (The Pas, Manitoba, Canada).The Lido Theatre was built in 1929 and designed by Max Blankstein. The Lido is the world\\'s longest continuously operating atmospheric theatre (87 years straight as of 2016). The interior features an outdoor Mediterranean courtyard motif. It was built to seat 600 people but the current configuration allows for 350. The Lido has avoided major renovations, remaining close to its original design. A rare survivor in its class, one of the few cinemas to stay in the same family for four generations, it remains owned by the Rivalin family.\\nMayfair Theatre (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).The Mayfair is a surviving atmospheric cinema of the Spanish Revival form, the second theatre house of this kind to be constructed in Ottawa. Interior features include four faux-balconies, two of which feature clay-tile canopies. Other significant features include stained-glass windows, a proscenium arch, a painted ceiling, decorative plastering and wrought ironwork. The Mayfair has retained the theatre clock used since its inception, a unit which features blue illuminated numbering.\\n\\nRialto Cinema (Dunedin, New Zealand).The Rialto Cinema originally seated 2,000. The cinema has been converted into a six-theater multiplex. Renovations in 1998 restored its Moorish-themed features and night sky.\\n\\nRoxy Theatre (Saskatoon, Canada).Built during the onset of the Great Depression. The interior was decorated in a Spanish Villa style with the walls covered with small balconies, windows and towers that gave the impression of quaint Spanish village. The ceiling was painted in an atmospheric-style (dark blue and had twinkling lights set in the plaster) to give the impression of the night sky. \\n\\nCineteca Alameda (San Luis Potosí City, Mexico).Located in the city center. The Cineteca Alameda was opened on 27 February 1941 with Marlene Dietrich in \"Seven Sinners\". Seating was originally provided for over 1,000 in orchestra and balcony levels. In recent years it was used for concerts, film festivals and for screening classic movies, it seems to have closed in 2012, but had reopened by 2014 offering a mix of art house movies and live performances. It seem only the orchestra seating area is currently being used.\\n\\nPalacio Chino (Mexico City, Mexico)The fancy Palacio Chino opened on March 29, 1940. It used the shell of a former ball court, whose space was sufficient for a big movie theatre. It was the only one built ever in Mexico in Chinese style, but unlike the Grauman\\'s Chinese, the interior was of the atmospheric type. In 1945 it was listed as having 4,000 seats in two levels, orchestra and balcony. It featured a fairly big stage, enough so to hold a symphony orchestra, and indeed was sometimes used as a music theater. Celibidache once directed the National Symphony Orchestra here, as an alternate theater to Bellas Artes, itself the home theater of said orchestra. The inevitable comparison with Grauman\\'s Chinese stands only as original inspiration goes, because both buildings are very different. The Palacio Chino has a big, traditional flat facade, right in front of Iturbide street. The many windows of this facade are adorned as small pagodas, and there is a big, ornate marquee. The vestibule was spacious and full of Chinese decorations, even the ticket boots were rendered as pagodas. The auditorium was of the atmospheric type, with pagodas, temples and gold Buddha statues amid gardens. The ceiling was vault-like, not flat but very arched, and of course was painted deep blue. The screen was protected by a heavy black curtain, with Chinese motifs painted upon. The screen arch was very heavily decorated, with dragons appearing here and there.\\n\\nCampbeltown Picture House (Campbeltown, Scotland)Purpose-built cinema constructed in 1913.

Though Brezhnev was unhurt, the shots killed a driver and lightly injured several celebrated cosmonauts of the Soviet space program who were present in the motorcade. Brezhnev\\'s attacker was captured and a news blackout on the event was maintained by the Soviet government for years thereafter.\\n\\n\\n== Would-be assassin ==\\nViktor Ivanovich Ilyin (Russian: Виктор Иванович Ильин) was born in Leningrad in 1947. After his graduation from a technical college, he was inducted into the Soviet Army in 1968 at the rank of lieutenant. Ilyin was said to have been resentful of his forced conscription and distressed by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.On 21 January 1969, Ilyin stole two standard-issue Makarov handguns and deserted his army unit. He went back to his family in Leningrad where he stole his brother-in-law\\'s authentic police uniform. Ilyin then left on an unannounced, solitary journey to Moscow.\\n\\n\\n== Cosmonauts\\' motorcade ==\\n\\nDressed as a policeman, Ilyin moved unimpeded through a large crowd waiting at the Kremlin. They were clustered at the Borovitsky Gate, where a special motorcade was expected to pass: it would be bearing the successful cosmonauts of Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 to an important official ceremony.\\nThe spaceflight crewmembers—Vladimir Shatalov, Boris Volynov, Yevgeny Khrunov, and Aleksei Yeliseyev—had returned only a week earlier from their historic manned-ship-to-manned-ship docking mission in space, the first of its kind. Arriving at Vnukovo Airport, they were being driven with Brezhnev and Soviet head of state Nikolai Podgorny to their commemorative celebration inside the Kremlin\\'s Palace of Congresses. The four honorees rode in an open convertible at the front of the line, waving to spectators while a line of closed limousines trailed behind them.\\n\\n\\n== Assassination attempt ==\\nAt 2:15 p.m. on 22 January 1969, as the motorcade passed through the gate, Ilyin drew pistols in both hands. Ignoring the waving cosmonauts, he opened fire on the second car in the line: he later admitted that he only assumed it carried Brezhnev, but this ZiL limousine was filled only with other cosmonauts from earlier missions: Alexei Leonov, Valentina Tereshkova, Georgy Beregovoy, and Andriyan Nikolayev.Ilyin\\'s shots struck the limousine fourteen times, killing the driver, Ilya Zharkov, before a guard ran Ilyin down with his motorcycle. The other occupants of the car were unscathed or suffered only superficial wounds. After Ilyin was arrested, the cosmonauts\\' ceremony took place as planned, slightly delayed.\\n\\n\\n== Aftermath ==\\n\\nIlyin underwent a lengthy interrogation led by KGB chief and future Soviet leader Yuri Andropov. During his interrogation, the recording of which was found in the Russian State Archives after 1991, Ilyin told Andropov that his motivation to assassinate Brezhnev was to have him replaced with his Second Secretary and Party Ideologue Mikhail Suslov (whom Ilyin called \"the most outstanding person in the party at the moment\"). Whether this was true or if he was simply trying to provoke infighting within the Politburo remains unknown. He was pronounced insane and sent to Kazan Psychiatric Hospital where he was kept in solitary confinement until 1988.According to Russian sources, Ilyin was released in 1990 and moved to Saint Petersburg. The bullet-holed limousine has been preserved and is occasionally put on public exhibition.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nNews was scant and slow to emerge. An official Soviet press statement was made two days after the shooting, but did not say if the shooter was a man or a woman. However, even without official confirmation, the event was seen as an assassination attempt on Brezhnev.Years later, the cosmonaut Leonov recounted how Brezhnev confided to him after the incident: \"Those bullets were not meant for you, Alexei. They were meant for me, and for that I apologize.\" But until the dissolution of the Soviet Union the KGB released little information about the shooting. The entire incident was \"so effectively hushed up\" that it was sometimes cited by Western observers as an example of Soviet secrecy.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n'], ['Buzz_Aldrin', 'Astronauts', 'Buzz Aldrin (; born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr.; January 20, 1930) is an American former astronaut,  engineer and fighter pilot. He made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission, and, as Lunar Module Eagle pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, he and mission commander Neil Armstrong were the first two people to land on the Moon. He is the last surviving crew member of Apollo 11.\\nBorn in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the United States Military Academy at West Point, with a degree in mechanical engineering. He was commissioned into the United States Air Force, and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War. He flew 66 combat missions and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.\\nAfter earning a Doctor of Science degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA\\'s Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, earning him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12 during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. A Presbyterian elder, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion. Apollo 11 effectively proved US victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade.\\nUpon leaving NASA in 1971, Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. He retired from the Air Force in 1972, after 21 years of service. His autobiographies Return to Earth (1973), and Magnificent Desolation (2009), recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. He continues to advocate for space exploration, particularly a human mission to Mars, and developed the Aldrin cycler, a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to Mars more efficient in regard to time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nAldrin was born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. on January 20, 1930, at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. His parents, Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr. and Marion Aldrin (née Moon), lived in neighboring Montclair. His father was an Army aviator during World War I and the assistant commandant of the Army\\'s test pilot school at McCook Field, Ohio, from 1919 to 1922, but left the Army in 1928 and became an executive at Standard Oil. Aldrin had two sisters: Madeleine, who was four years older, and Fay Ann, who was a year and a half older. His nickname, which became his legal first name in 1988, arose as a result of Fay\\'s mispronouncing \"brother\" as \"buzzer\", which was then shortened to \"Buzz\". He was a Boy Scout, achieving the rank of Tenderfoot Scout.Aldrin did well in school, maintaining an A average. He played football and was the starting center for Montclair High School\\'s undefeated 1946 state champion team. His father wanted him to go to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland and enrolled him at nearby Severn School, a preparatory school for Annapolis and even secured him an appointment from Albert W. Hawkes, one of the United States senators from New Jersey. Aldrin attended Severn School in 1946, but had other ideas about his future career. He suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes. He faced down his father and told him to ask Hawkes to change the nomination to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.Aldrin entered West Point in 1947. He did well academically, finishing first in his class his plebe (first) year. Aldrin was also an excellent athlete, competing in pole vault for the academy track and field team. In 1950, he traveled with a group of West Point cadets to Japan and the Philippines to study the military government policies of Douglas MacArthur. During the trip, the Korean War broke out. On June 5, 1951, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering.\\n\\n\\n== Military career ==\\nAs one of the highest-ranking members of the class, Aldrin had his choice of assignments. He chose the United States Air Force, which had become a separate service in 1947 while Aldrin was still at West Point and did not yet have its own academy. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and underwent basic flight training in T-6 Texans at Bartow Air Base in Florida. His classmates included Sam Johnson, who later became a prisoner of war in Vietnam; the two became friends. At one point, Aldrin attempted a double Immelmann turn in a T-28 Trojan and suffered a grayout. He recovered in time to pull out at 200 feet (61 m), averting what would have been a fatal crash.\\n\\nWhen Aldrin was deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly, his father advised him to choose bombers, because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills, which could open up better prospects for career advancement. Aldrin chose instead to fly fighters. He moved to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, where he learned to fly the F-80 Shooting Star and the F-86 Sabre. Like most jet fighter pilots of the era, he preferred the latter.In December 1952, Aldrin was assigned to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was part of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. At the time it was based at Suwon Air Base, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Seoul, and was engaged in combat operations as part of the Korean War. During an acclimatization flight, his main fuel system froze at 100 percent power, which would have soon used up all his fuel. He was able to override the setting manually, but this required holding a button down, which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio. He barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence. He flew 66 combat missions in F-86 Sabres in Korea and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.The first MiG-15 he shot down was on May 14, 1953. Aldrin was flying about 5 miles (8.0 km) south of the Yalu River, when he saw two MiG-15 fighters below him. Aldrin opened fire on one of the MiGs, whose pilot may never have seen him coming. The June 8, 1953, issue of Life magazine featured gun camera footage taken by Aldrin of the pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft.\\n\\nAldrin\\'s second aerial victory came on June 4, 1953, when he accompanied aircraft from the 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in an attack on an airbase in North Korea. Their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up. He then spotted a MiG approaching from above. This time, Aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about the same time. They went through a series of scissor maneuvers, attempting to get behind the other. Aldrin was first to do so, but his gun sight jammed. He then manually sighted his gun and fired. He then had to pull out, as the two aircraft had gotten too low for the dogfight to continue. Aldrin saw the MiG\\'s canopy open and the pilot eject, although Aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open. For his service in Korea, he was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and three Air Medals.Aldrin\\'s year-long tour ended in December 1953, by which time the fighting in Korea had ended. Aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at Nellis. In December 1954 he became an aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Don Z. Zimmerman, the Dean of Faculty at the nascent United States Air Force Academy, which opened in 1955. That same year, he graduated from the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. From 1956 to 1959 he flew F-100 Super Sabres equipped with nuclear weapons as a flight commander in the 22nd Fighter Squadron, 36th Fighter Wing, stationed at Bitburg Air Base in West Germany. Among his squadron colleagues was Ed White, who had been a year behind him at West Point. After White left Germany to study for a master\\'s degree at the University of Michigan in aeronautical engineering, he wrote to Aldrin encouraging him to do the same.\\n\\nThrough the Air Force Institute of Technology, Aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959, intending to earn a master\\'s degree. His astrodynamics class was taught by Richard Battin. Two other USAF officers who later became astronauts, David Scott and Edgar Mitchell, took this course around this time, while another, Charles Duke, wrote his 1964 master\\'s degree at MIT under the supervision of Laurence R. Young.Aldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead. In January 1963, he earned a Sc.D. degree in astronautics. His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, the dedication of which read: \"In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country\\'s present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!\" Aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in the hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut, although it meant foregoing test pilot training, which was a prerequisite at the time.On the completion of his doctorate, Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Los Angeles, working with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation on enhancing the maneuver capabilities of the Agena target vehicle which was to be used by NASA\\'s Project Gemini. He was then posted to the Space Systems Division\\'s field office at NASA\\'s Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, where he was involved in integrating Department of Defense experiments into Project Gemini flights.\\n\\n\\n== NASA career ==\\nAldrin\\'s initial application to join the astronaut corps when NASA\\'s Astronaut Group 2 was selected in 1962 was rejected on the grounds that he was not a test pilot. He was aware of the requirement and asked for it to be waived, but the request was turned down. On May 15, 1963, NASA announced another round of selections, this time with the requirement that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1,000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft. Aldrin had over 2,500 hours of flying time, of which 2,200 was in jets. His selection as one of fourteen members of NASA\\'s Astronaut Group 3 was announced on October 18, 1963. This made him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree which, combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics, earned him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from his fellow astronauts. Although Aldrin was both the most educated and the rendezvous expert in the astronaut corps, he was aware that the nickname was not always intended as a compliment. Upon completion of initial training, each new astronaut was assigned a field of expertise; in Aldrin\\'s case, it was mission planning, trajectory analysis, and flight plans.\\n\\n\\n=== Gemini program ===\\n\\nJim Lovell and Aldrin were selected as the backup crew of Gemini 10, commander and pilot respectively. Backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission, but the last scheduled mission in the program was Gemini 12. The February 28, 1966, deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, in an air crash, led to Lovell and Aldrin being moved up one mission to backup for Gemini 9, which put them in position as prime crew for Gemini 12. They were designated its prime crew on June 17, 1966, with Gordon Cooper and Gene Cernan as their backups.\\n\\n\\n==== Gemini 12 ====\\n\\nInitially, Gemini 12\\'s mission objectives were uncertain. As the last scheduled mission, it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions. While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous during Project Gemini, the gravity-gradient stabilization test on Gemini 11 was unsuccessful. NASA also had concerns about extravehicular activity (EVA). Cernan on Gemini 9 and Richard Gordon on Gemini 11 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during EVA, but Michael Collins had a successful EVA on Gemini 10, which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor.It therefore fell to Aldrin to complete Gemini\\'s EVA goals. NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success. It dropped the test of the Air Force\\'s astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) that had given Gordon trouble on Gemini 11 so Aldrin could focus on EVA. NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over parabolic flight. Aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training, but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest. It also encouraged performing tasks quickly, whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately. Training in a viscous, buoyant fluid gave a better simulation. NASA also placed additional handholds on the capsule, which were increased from nine on Gemini 9 to 44 on Gemini 12, and created workstations where he could anchor his feet.\\n\\nGemini 12\\'s main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization, perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three EVAs, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. Gemini 12 also carried 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments. It was not a trailblazing mission; rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by Gemini 9, and the tethered vehicle exercise by Gemini 11. Even gravity-gradient stabilization had been attempted by Gemini 11, albeit unsuccessfully.Gemini 12 was launched from Launch Complex 19 at Cape Canaveral on 20:46 UTC on November 11, 1966. The Gemini Agena Target Vehicle had been launched about an hour and a half before. The mission\\'s first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle. As the target and Gemini 12 capsule drew closer together, radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable, forcing the crew to rendezvous manually. Aldrin used a sextant and rendezvous charts he helped create to give Lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to dock with the target vehicle. Gemini 12 achieved the fourth docking with an Agena target vehicle.The next task was to practice undocking and docking again. On undocking, one of the three latches caught, and Lovell had to use the Gemini\\'s thrusters to free the spacecraft. Aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later. The flight plan then called for the Agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit, but eight minutes after the Agena had been launched, it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure. The Mission and Flight Directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine. This would be the only mission objective that was not achieved. Instead, the Agena\\'s secondary propulsion system was used to allow the spacecraft to view the solar eclipse of November 12, 1966, over South America, which Lovell and Aldrin photographed through the spacecraft windows.\\n\\nAldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and twenty minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. Aldrin performed numerous tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for Project Apollo. A dozen two-minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued. His second EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.On November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, where they were picked up by a helicopter, which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier USS Wasp. After the mission, his wife realized he had fallen into a depression, something she had not seen before.\\n\\n\\n=== Apollo program ===\\n\\nLovell and Aldrin were assigned to an Apollo crew with Neil Armstrong as Commander, Lovell as Command Module Pilot (CMP), and Aldrin as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). Their assignment as the backup crew of Apollo 9 was announced on November 20, 1967. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong\\'s crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Under the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was expected to command Apollo 11.\\n\\nMichael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo 8 prime crew, required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine. Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew. When Collins recovered he joined Armstrong\\'s crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8. While the CMP usually occupied the center couch on launch, Aldrin occupied it rather than Collins, as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before Collins arrived.Apollo 11 was the second American space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space, the first being Apollo 10. The next would not be flown until STS-26 in 1988. Deke Slayton, who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments, gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong thought it over for a day before declining. He had no issues working with Aldrin, and thought Lovell deserved his own command.Early versions of the EVA checklist had the Lunar Module Pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin\\'s views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions. Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".\\nAldrin and Armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training. The first lunar landing focused more on landing on the Moon and making it safely back to Earth than the scientific aspects of the mission. The duo was briefed by NASA and USGS geologists. They made one geological field trip to West Texas. The press followed them, and a helicopter made it hard for Aldrin and Armstrong to hear their instructor.\\n\\n\\n==== Apollo 11 ====\\n\\nOn the morning of July 16, 1969, an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more listened to radio broadcasts. Propelled by a Saturn V rocket, Apollo 11 lifted off from Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 EDT), and entered Earth orbit twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About thirty minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the command module Columbia from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with lunar module Eagle. After the lunar module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.\\n \\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquillity about 12 miles (19 km) southwest of the crater Sabine D. At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered Eagle, and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 Eagle separated from the Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear had correctly deployed.Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the Eagle. Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800 m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM guidance computer (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. The Eagle landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.As a Presbyterian elder, Aldrin was the first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. He radioed Earth: \"I\\'d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.\" Using a kit given to him by his pastor, he took communion and read Jesus\\'s words from the New Testament\\'s John 15:5, as Aldrin records it: \"I am the vine. You are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.\" But he kept this ceremony secret because of a lawsuit over the reading of Genesis on Apollo 8. In 1970 he commented: \"It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.\"On reflection in his 2009 book, Aldrin said, \"Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind – be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience than by giving thanks to God.\" Aldrin shortly hit upon a more universally human reference on the voyage back to Earth by publicly broadcasting his reading of the Old Testament\\'s Psalm 8:3–4, as Aldrin records: \"When I considered the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him.\" Photos of these liturgical documents reveal the conflict\\'s development as Aldrin expresses faith.\\n\\nPreparations for the EVA began at 23:43. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, and the hatch was opened at 02:39:33 on July 21. Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface. Armstrong and Aldrin became the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. Aldrin\\'s first words after he set foot on the Moon were \"Beautiful view\", to which Armstrong asked \"Isn\\'t that something? Magnificent sight out here.\" Aldrin answered, \"Magnificent desolation.\" Aldrin and Armstrong had trouble erecting the Lunar Flag Assembly, but with some effort secured it into the surface. Aldrin saluted the flag and Armstrong took an iconic photo of the scene. Aldrin positioned himself in front of the video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about the lunar surface to aid future moonwalkers. During these experiments, President Nixon called the duo to congratulate them on the successful landing. Nixon closed with, \"Thank you very much, and all of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.\" Aldrin replied, \"I look forward to that very much, sir.\"After the call, Aldrin began photographing and inspecting the spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight. Aldrin and Armstrong then set up a seismometer, to detect moonquakes, and a laser beam reflector. While Armstrong inspected a crater, Aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample. Most of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the Moon taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts are of Aldrin; Armstrong appears in just two color photographs. \"As the sequence of lunar operations evolved,\" Aldrin explained, \"Neil had the camera most of the time, and the majority of the pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn\\'t until we were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this during our training.\"Aldrin reentered Eagle first but, as he tells it, before ascending the module\\'s   ladder he became the first person to urinate on the Moon. With some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5 lb) of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. It contained a mission patch for the Apollo 1 flight that Ed White never flew due to his death in a cabin fire during the launch rehearsal; medallions commemorating Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and Vladimir Komarov, the first man to die in a space flight, and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01, and they repressurized the lunar module and settled down to sleep.\\n\\nAt 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle\\'s ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit. After rendezvous with Columbia, the ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit, and Columbia made its way back to Earth. It splashed down in the Pacific 2,660 km (1,440 nmi) east of Wake Island at 16:50 UTC (05:50 local time) on July 24. The total mission duration was 195 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds.Bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered a possibility, albeit remote, so divers passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter, and flown to the aircraft carrier USS Hornet, where they spent the first part of the Earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine. On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million people. An official state dinner that evening in Los Angeles celebrated the flight. President Richard Nixon honored each of them with the highest American civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (with distinction).On September 16, 1969, the astronauts addressed a joint session of Congress where they thanked the representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding the space effort. The astronauts embarked on a 38-day world tour on September 29 that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries. The last leg of the tour included Australia, South Korea, and Japan; the crew returned to the US on November 5, 1969.After Apollo 11, Aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances. In October 1970, he joined Soviet cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov on their tour of the NASA space centers. He was also involved in the design of the Space Shuttle. With the Apollo program coming to an end, Aldrin, now a colonel, saw few prospects at NASA, and decided to return to the Air Force on July 1, 1971. During his NASA career, he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space, of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in EVA.\\n\\n\\n== Post-NASA activities ==\\n\\n\\n=== Aerospace Research Pilot School ===\\n\\nAldrin hoped to become Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, but the job went to his West Point classmate Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr. Aldrin was made Commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience, but a third of the training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified F-104 Starfighter to the edge of space. Fellow Group 3 astronaut and moonwalker Alan Bean considered him well qualified for the job.Aldrin did not get along well with his superior, Brigadier General Robert M. White, who had earned his USAF astronaut wings flying the X-15. Aldrin\\'s celebrity status led people to defer to him more than the higher-ranking general. There were two crashes at Edwards, of an A-7 Corsair II and a T-33. No lives were lost, but the aircraft were destroyed and the accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision, which placed the blame on Aldrin. What he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful one.Aldrin went to see the base surgeon. In addition to signs of depression, he experienced neck and shoulder pains, and hoped that the latter might explain the former. He was hospitalized for depression at Wilford Hall Medical Center for four weeks. His mother had committed suicide in May 1968, and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after Gemini 12 had contributed. His mother\\'s father had also committed suicide, and he believed he inherited depression from them. At the time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career-ending, but could result in his being ostracized socially.In February 1972, General George S. Brown paid a visit to Edwards and informed Aldrin that the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School was being renamed the USAF Test Pilot School and the astronaut training was being dropped. With the Apollo program winding down, and Air Force budgets being cut, the Air Force\\'s interest in space diminished. Aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on March 1, 1972, after 21 years of service. His father and General Jimmy Doolittle, a close friend of his father, attended the formal retirement ceremony.\\n\\n\\n=== Post retirement ===\\nAldrin\\'s father died on December 28, 1974, from complications following a heart attack. Aldrin\\'s autobiographies Return to Earth, (1973) and Magnificent Desolation (2009), recounted his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. Encouraged by a therapist to take a regular job, Aldrin worked selling used cars, at which he had no talent. Periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking. Eventually he was arrested for disorderly conduct. Finally, in October 1978, he quit drinking for good. Aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems, including actor William Holden. Holden\\'s girlfriend Stefanie Powers had portrayed Marianne, a woman with whom Aldrin had an affair, in the 1976 TV movie version of Return to Earth. Aldrin was saddened by Holden\\'s alcohol-related death in 1981.\\n\\n\\n=== Bart Sibrel incident ===\\nOn September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a Beverly Hills hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children\\'s television show on the subject of space. When he arrived, Moon landing conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were not faked. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel followed Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, and called him \"a coward, a liar, and a thief\" the 72-year-old Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel\\'s film crew. Aldrin said he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter. Witnesses said Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with a Bible. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no criminal record. The police declined to press charges against Aldrin.\\n\\n\\n=== Detached adapter panel sighting ===\\nIn 2005, while being interviewed for a Science Channel documentary titled First on the Moon: The Untold Story, Aldrin told an interviewer they had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO). The documentary makers omitted the crew\\'s conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels from the upper stage of the Saturn V rocket. The panels had been jettisoned before the separation maneuver so they closely followed the spacecraft until the first mid-course correction. When Aldrin appeared on The Howard Stern Show on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, \"99.9 percent\" sure the object was the detached panel. According to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to make a correction, but was refused.\\n\\n\\n=== Polar expedition ===\\nIn December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand. At 86 years of age, Aldrin\\'s visit made him the oldest person to reach the South Pole. He had traveled to the North Pole in 1998.\\n\\n\\n== Mission to Mars advocacy ==\\n\\nAfter leaving NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the University of North Dakota (UND)\\'s College of Aerospace Sciences at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college. Aldrin helped to develop UND\\'s Space Studies program and brought Dr. David Webb from NASA to serve as the department\\'s first chair. To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, Talib Kweli, and Soulja Boy to create the rap single and video \"Rocket Experience\", proceeds from which were donated to Aldrin\\'s non-profit foundation, ShareSpace.In 1985, Aldrin proposed a special spacecraft trajectory now known as the Aldrin cycler. Cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to Mars by using less propellant. The Aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, with a return trip to Earth of the same duration on a twin cycler orbit. Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University. In 1996 Aldrin founded Starcraft Boosters, Inc. (SBI) to design reusable rocket launchers.In December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in The New York Times criticizing NASA\\'s objectives. In it, he voiced concern about NASA\\'s development of a spacecraft \"limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability\" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was \"more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs\".In a June 2013 opinion piece in The New York Times, Aldrin supported a human mission to Mars and which viewed the Moon \"not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.\" In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the Florida Institute of Technology, presented a master plan to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a tour of duty of ten years, establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\n\\nAldrin was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1969 for his role as lunar module pilot on Apollo 11. He was awarded an oak leaf cluster in 1972 in lieu of a second DSM for his role in both the Korean War and in the space program, and the Legion of Merit for his role in the Gemini and Apollo programs.

His first marriage was on December 29, 1954, to Joan Archer, a Rutgers University and Columbia University alumna with a master\\'s degree. They had three children, James, Janice and Andrew. They filed for divorce in 1974. His second was to Beverly Van Zile, whom he married on December 31, 1975, and divorced in 1978. His third was to Lois Driggs Cannon, whom he married on February 14, 1988. Their divorce was finalized in December 2012. The settlement included 50 percent of their $475,000 bank account, and $9,500 a month plus 30 percent of his annual income, estimated at more than $600,000. As of 2017, he has one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter Janice, and three great-grandsons and one great-granddaughter.In 2018 Aldrin was involved in a legal dispute with his children Andrew and Janice and former business manager Christina Korp over their claims that he was mentally impaired through dementia and Alzheimer\\'s disease. His children alleged that he made new friends who were alienating him from the family and encouraging him to spend his savings at a high rate. They sought to be named legal guardians so they could control his finances. In June, Aldrin filed a lawsuit against Andrew, Janice, Korp, and businesses and foundations run by the family. Aldrin alleged that Janice was not acting in his financial interests and that Korp was exploiting the elderly. He sought to remove Andrew\\'s control of Aldrin\\'s social media accounts, finances, and businesses. The situation ended when his children withdrew their petition and he dropped the lawsuit in March 2019, several months before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.\\n\\nAldrin is an active supporter of the Republican Party, headlining fundraisers for its members of Congress and endorsing its candidates.

Bush in 2004 and campaigned for Nick Lampson in Texas in 2006, Paul Rancatore in Florida in 2008, Mead Treadwell in Alaska in 2014 and Dan Crenshaw in Texas in 2018. He appeared at the 2019 State of the Union Address as a guest of President Donald Trump.\\nFollowing the 2012 death of his Apollo 11 colleague Neil Armstrong, Aldrin said he was deeply saddened by the passing ... I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew ... I had truly hoped that on July 20, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing.\\nIn 2007, Aldrin confirmed to Time magazine that he had recently had a face-lift, joking that the g-forces he was exposed to in space \"caused a sagging jowl that needed some attention.\" He primarily resided in the Los Angeles area, including Beverly Hills and Laguna Beach and Emerald Bay.

The team later rejoins the central X-Men. Sam is injured on a mission and once again decided to break for some peace.

During the fight, Smasher and the U.S.Avengers arrive to help. After Ritchie and his army are sent to prison, the heroes head back home.\\n\\n\\n== Powers and abilities ==\\nCannonball is a mutant who possesses the ability to bodily generate thermo-chemical energy and release it from his skin. This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through the air like a rocket, at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but now he can fire it from almost any part of his body, to a wide variety of effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible \"blast field\" that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.\\nHis power levels have varied over the years - but at his peak, he has been able to absorb (and redirect) the force of one of Gladiator\\'s punches.He may also be a member of the immortal mutant group the Externals, due to his apparent ability to return to life after death.\\n\\n\\n== Other versions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Age of Apocalypse ===\\nIn the Age of Apocalypse storyline, the Guthrie family was eliminated during the Cullings, with only Sam, Paige, Elisabeth, and Joshua being spared due to their mutant status. They were approached by Mister Sinister, who offered them the chance to become part of his Elite Mutant Force. Sam took on the alias Cannonball and became a member of the EMF alongside his sister, Elisabeth, a.k.a. Amazon. He and his sister were particularly violent towards the prisoners of Sinister\\'s breeding pens, as was their superior Havok, to whom Cannonball was loyal. When the Elite Mutant Force was taken over by Havok due to Prelate Cyclops\\' betrayal, Cannonball fought the Bedlam brothers, who sided with the older Summers brother. Cannonball and Amazon survived and eventually reunited with Husk, whom they rescue from the Seattle Core, and Icarus, and together they set out to fulfill Husk\\'s \"revenge\" against the X-Men for Colossus\\' abandonment of her in the Core. He, along with his siblings, was killed in fighting the X-Men, personally being crushed in a metallic orb along with his brother by Magneto.\\n\\n\\n=== Age of X ===\\nIn the Age of X reality, Cannonball and Husk are shown breaking mutants out of prison and slaying the mutant hunters. They are then approached by Magneto and his team of X-Men to join up with them.\\n\\n\\n=== Year 2043 ===\\nIn the ongoing Cable series, set in 2043, an older Cannonball arrives when Cable is badly hurt and unable to time travel. Solicitations of the comics refer to Cannonball as Cable\\'s \"old war buddy.\" Cannonball implies that he, Cable, Bishop, and the baby are the last living mutants, and that he found him with Cerebra, which was rigged for non-psychics to use after the last psychic died. Cannonball allows Cable to escape with the child, opting to stay and distract Bishop. Bishop pleads with Sam not to fight, but Cannonball persists, harboring a decades-long grudge against the traitorous former X-Man, and after a long fight, Bishop is forced to kill him using a claw-like tentacle from his new bionic arm (stolen from Forge) to rip out Guthrie\\'s heart. As Cannonball dies, he asks Bishop why, to which Bishop responds, with visions of his future, mutants with M\\'s on their faces and herded into concentration camps, \"To save you\".\\n\\n\\n=== House of M ===\\nCannonball had no House of M counterpart because he was traveling through realities with Siryn and Deadpool when the change wave occurred. However, Wolverine did beat up a young blond man for his motorbike, which was called the \\'Cannonball X\\'.\\n\\n\\n=== Last Avengers Story ===\\nIn an alternate future, Hank Pym recruits Cannonball to be part of a new Avengers, to fight Ultron and Kang. In the climactic battle, Kang murders Guthrie with a shot to the head.\\n\\n\\n=== Marvel Zombies ===\\nIn Ultimate Fantastic Four #23, Sam, wearing his yellow and black New Mutants uniform, is one of the dozens of zombies endangering a small trio of humans, Magneto and \\'Ultimate\\' Reed Richards. They had tracked down the humans through the ruins of Manhattan; most of the rest of the Earth had been consumed already.\\n\\n\\n=== Mutant X ===\\nIn the Mutant X universe, Sam was drawn as a very overweight mutant while his sister had an ugly appearance. The two would constantly insult one another. Due to his increased weight, Sam couldn\\'t stay in Cannonball mode for long. The two worked with Wolfsbane, Sunspot, and Jubilee as the \\'Marauders\\', a murderous band of thieves based in the sewers.\\n\\n\\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\\nIn the Ultimate universe, Cannonball is a member of Emma Frost\\'s Academy of Tomorrow, a somewhat more pacifistic alternative to the X-Men. He is the newest member.When fellow student Lorna Dane is framed for murder and thus imprisoned in the Triskelion her boyfriend, Alex Summers, recruits a strike team. Sam and Alex are joined by Sunspot, Douglas Ramsey, and Northstar. During the trip to New York, the team becomes lost and is ambushed by the X-Men.

These caste systems feature endogamy, hierarchical status, inherited occupation, membership by birth, pollution concepts and restraints on commensality.The specifics of the caste systems in Africa vary among the ethnic groups. Some societies have a rigid and strict caste system with embedded slavery, whereas others are more diffuse and complex. Countries in Africa that have societies with caste systems include Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Niger, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Liberia, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Nigeria, Chad, Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and others. While it is unclear when and how the caste systems developed in Africa, they are not ancient and likely developed sometime between the 9th century and 15th century in various ethnic groups, probably in conjunction with the institution of slavery.\\n\\n\\n== East Africa ==\\n\\n\\n=== Amhara people ===\\n\\nThe social stratification of the Amhara people of Ethiopia includes castes. According to Donald Levine – a professor of Sociology specializing in Ethiopian society, the Amhara society has consisted of high-ranking clans, low-ranking clans, caste groups (artisans), and slaves. The Amhara caste system was hierarchically higher than its lowest slaves strata.The Amhara caste system consisted of: (1) endogamy, (2) hierarchical status, (3) restraints on commensality, (4) pollution concepts, (5) each caste has had a traditional occupation, and (6) inherited caste membership. This caste system has been a rigid, endogamous and occupationally closed social stratification among Amhara and other Afro-Asiatic-speaking Ethiopian ethnic groups. However, some state it as an economically closed, endogamous class system or as occupational minorities, whereas others such as the historian David Todd state that this system can be unequivocally labelled as caste-based.\\n\\n\\n=== Borana people ===\\nThe Borana people are found in southern Ethiopia and northeastern Kenya. They have historically had castes, among which the hunters and artisans have constituted the depressed strata. These are endogamous castes each with a specialized inherited occupation, and include a strata that constitutes outcastes. They are found in virtually every Cushitic or Semitic community of this region. These castes are neither Negroid nor Bushmanoid by physical features or their first language.The lower castes of the Borana people, states Herbert Lewis – a professor of Anthropology specializing on East African societies, show no physical differences from the noble castes of Somalia and Somalilands. Other than endogamy and occupational differences between the castes, their ritual, social and political positions are different, as are the beliefs held by each about the nature of the other. For example, the castes have long considered each other as ritually impure, and food prepared by either nobles or artisans castes is considered a taboo to others. Similarly, traditionally, the craftsman and the noble are ritually forbidden to enter the house of the other. Low caste people are expected not to handle farm equipment or cattle.In Ethiopia, the outcaste groups include the Weyto, who live on the shores of Lake Tana and are despised for eating hippopotamus meat.\\n\\n\\n=== Oromo people ===\\nThe Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, also found in northern Kenya and Somalia, with an estimated total population of over 35 million.Like other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, Oromo people regionally developed social stratification consisting of four hierarchical strata. The highest strata were the nobles called the Borana, below them were the Gabbaro (some 17th to 19th century Ethiopian texts refer them as the dhalatta). Below these two upper castes were the despised castes of artisans, and at the lowest level were the slaves.In the Islamic Kingdom of Jimma, the Oromo society\\'s caste strata predominantly consisted of endogamous, inherited artisanal occupations. Each caste group has specialized in a particular occupation such as iron working, carpentry, weapon making, pottery, weaving, leather working and hunting.The castes in the Oromo society have had a designated name, such as Tumtu were smiths, Fuga were potters, Faqi were tanners and leatherworkers, Semmano for weavers, Gagurtu were bee keepers and honey makers, Watta were hunters and foragers. While slaves were an endogamous strata within the Oromo society, they themselves were also victims of slavery. By the 19th century, Oromo slaves were sought after and a major part of slaves sold in Gondar and Gallabat slave markets at Ethiopia–Sudan border, as well as the Massawa and Tajura markets on the Red Sea.\\n\\n\\n=== Somali people ===\\nThe Somalis are an ethnic group of between 15 and 20 million people, constituting the largest ethnicity in Somalia, many of whom also live in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti.They have historically exhibited social stratification that has included embedded castes referred to as Higal (or Higalki, Argobba). The upper noble strata has been called Gob (or Asha), while the lower servile strata have been referred to as Sáb. The three main Somali castes are called Tumal (sometimes spelled Tomal), Midgan and Yibir (sometimes spelled Yebir). These fell outside of the traditional clan structure. The castes have been endogamous, a person born into it inherited its occupation. The Midgan have been the hunters, Tumal were the smiths, pottery and leatherworking caste, and the Yibir have been the saddle and prayer mat makers and magician caste. Below the castes have been the Somali Bantus Jareer community, and these have been descendants of former slaves, including those who were runaway and emancipated slaves.According to Mohamed Eno and Abdi Kusow, the Somali caste communities are ethnically indistinguishable from each other, but upper castes have stigmatized the lower ones with mythical narratives such as they being of unholy origins or being engaged in dirty occupations. The four strata social system – high lineage, low lineage, caste groups and slaves – found among the Somalis has been common in the Horn of Africa region, states Donald Levine, and is also found among ethnic groups such as Afar, Amhara, Borana, Leqa, Sidamo, Kefa, Janjero and other peoples.According to Catherine Besteman - a professor of Anthropology, the widespread purchase of non-Somali African slaves during the medieval age helped structure the complex status hierarchy among the Somalis. However, adds Besteman, the Somali people from the upper strata have also been egalitarian in matters of clan leadership, while they have included concepts of social status, inferiority and exclusion of Sáb and slaves. In the northern regions where Somalis are traditionally found, states Iaon Lewis, Somali communities have traditionally distinguished between the artisanal Somali castes and their slaves, but in the south they have blurred these distinctions.The castes among Somali people have also existed in other east and northeast African ethnic groups. In east African ethnic groups, such as the Oromo people for example, cognates to Somali castes have been recorded in 16th century texts, states Cornelius Jaenen. The table below illustrate some alternate terms for castes mirroring the Somali Madhiban in other ethnic groups that share this region with the Somali people. Similarly, equivalent terms for castes in other northeast and east African ethnic groups mirror other castes such as the Tomal and the Yibir of Somali people.\\n\\n\\n== North Africa ==\\n\\n\\n=== Moors ===\\nThe Muslim Moors society in the Maghreb parts of the North Africa was traditionally (and still is, to some extent) stratified. According to Rebecca Popenoe – a professor of Anthropology, while the Islamic scriptures do not dictate a caste system, and while caste systems are not divinely ordained . In Mauritanian context, the Kafa\\'ah doctrine has been developed as a justification for considering family status before marriage, annulment of marriages between unequal people, and endogamy.Moors have owned slaves for centuries. The slaves are traditionally called Haratin and `Abid, and they were the lowest status endogamous castes, largely segregated oasis-dwelling black people, in the Moors society.The Haratin of Mauritania, states Joseph Hellweg – a professor of Anthropology specializing on West African studies, were part of a social caste-like hierarchy that likely developed between 1300 to 1500 CE because of a Bedouin legacy. The \"Hassan\" monopolized the occupations related to war and politics, the \"Zwaya\" (Zawaya) the religious roles, the \"Bidan\" (White Moors) owned property and held slaves (Haratins, Black Moors), and the slaves constituted the lowest of the social strata. Each of these were castes, endogamous, with hereditary occupations and where the upper strata collected tribute (horma) from the lower strata of Mauritanian society, considered them socially inferior, and denied them the right to own land or weapons thereby creating a socio-economically closed system.Among Hassaniya Arabic speakers in southern Morocco and Mauritania, states Sean Hanretta – a professor of African History, the term Bidan is a \"caste synecdoche\" that refers to Hassani (warrior) and Zwaya (clerical) clans. In the slave castes, they recognized two layers, the `Abid (slaves) and Haratins (freed slaves). According to Remco Ensel – a professor of Anthropology specializing in Maghreb studies, the word \"Haratin\" in Moroccan is a pejorative that connotes \"subordination, disrepute\" and in contemporary literature, it is often replaced with \"Drawi\", \"Drawa\", \"Sahrawi\", \"Sahrawa\" or other regional terms. The Haratins historically lived segregated from the main society, in a rural isolation. Their subjugation regardless of their religion was sometimes ideologically justified by nobles and some Islamic scholars, even though some scholars took a more nuanced view that Muslims can only enslave non-Muslims and they should not enslave other Muslims, states Hamel – a professor of History specializing in African Studies. They along with Swasin in Morocco and other northern fringe societies of the Sahara, were a part of a social hierarchy that included the upper strata of nobles, religious specialists and literati, followed by freemen, nomadic pastoral strata and slaves. The Haratin were hierarchically higher than the `Abid (descendant of slaves) at the very bottom, but lower than Ahrar. This hierarchy, states Ensel, has been variously described as ethnic groups, estates, quasi-castes, castes or classes.\\n\\n\\n=== Tuareg people ===\\nThe Tuareg people are a large Berber ethnic confederation found in North Africa. They principally inhabit the Sahara desert, in a vast area stretching from far southwestern Libya to southern Algeria, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Traditionally nomadic pastoralists, small groups of Tuareg are also found in northern Nigeria. Tuareg society has traditionally featured clan membership, social status and caste hierarchies within each political confederation. These hierarchical systems have included nobles, clerics, craftsmen and unfree strata of people.In Tuareg hierarchical caste system, the nobles constitute the highest caste. They are known in the Tuareg language as imúšaɣ (Imajaghan, \"the proud and free\" in the amazigh language). The nobles had a monopoly on carrying arms and camels, were the warriors of the Tuareg regions. They may have achieved their social status by subjugating other Tuareg castes, keeping arms to defend their properties and vassals. They have also collected tribute from their vassals. This warrior nobility has traditionally married within their caste, not to individuals in strata below their own. A collection of tribes, each led by a noble, forms a confederation called amanokal, whose chieftain is elected from among the nobles by the tribal chiefs. The chietain is the overlord during times of war, and receives tribute and taxes from tribes as a sign of their submission to his authority.The vassal-herdsmen are the second free strata within Tuareg society, occupying a position just below that of the nobles. They are known as ímɣad (Imghad, singular Amghid) in the Tuareg language. Although the vassals were also free, they did not own camels but instead kept donkeys and herds of goats, sheep and oxen. They pastured and tended their own herds as well those owned by the nobles of the confederation. The vassal strata have traditionally paid an annual tiwse, or tribute to the nobles as a part of their status obligations, and also hosted any noble who is traveling through their territory. In late medieval era, states Prasse, this weapon monopoly broke down after regional wars took a heavy toll on the noble warrior strata, and thereafter the vassals carried weapons as well and were recruited as warriors. After the start of the French colonial rule which dislodged the nobles from their powers over war and taxation, the Tuaregs belonging to the noble strata disdained tending cattle and tilling the land, seeking instead warrior or intellectual work.A semi-noble strata of the Tuareg people has been the endogamous religious clerics, the marabouts (Tuareg: Ineslemen, a loan word that means Muslim in Arabic). After the adoption of Islam, they became integral to the Tuareg social structure. According to Norris, this strata of Muslim clerics has been a sacredotal caste, which propagated Islam in North Africa and the Sahel between the 7th and the 17th centuries. Adherence to the faith was initially centered around this caste, but later spread to the wider Tuareg community. The marabouts have traditionally been the judges (qadi) and religious leaders (imam) of a Tuareg community.According to the anthropologist Jeffrey Heath, Tuareg artisans belong to separate endogamous castes known as the Inhædˤæn (Inadan). These have included the blacksmith, jewelers, wood workers and leather artisan castes. They produced and repaired the saddles, tools, household items and other items for the Tuareg community. In Niger and Mali, where the largest Tuareg populations are found, the artisan castes were attached as clients to a family of nobles or vassals, and carried messages over distances for their patron family. They also are the ones who traditionally sacrifice animals during Islamic festivals.These social strata, like caste systems found in many parts of West Africa, included singers, musicians and story tellers of the Tuareg, who kept their oral traditions. They are called Agguta by Tuareg, have been called upon to sing during ceremonies such as weddings or funerals. The origins of the artisanal castes are unclear. One theory posits a Jewish derivation, a proposal that Prasse calls \"a much vexed question\". Their association with fire, iron and precious metals and their reputation for being cunning tradesman has led others to treat them with a mix of admiration and distrust.According to Rasmussen, the Tuareg castes are not only hierarchical, as each caste differs in mutual perception, food and eating behaviors. On this point, she relates an explanation by a smith on why there is endogamy among castes among Tuareg in Niger. The smith explained, \"Nobles are like rice, Smiths are like millet, Slaves are like corn.\"In the Tuareg areas of Algeria, a distinct tenant-peasant strata lives around oases known as izeggaren (or haratin in Arabic). Traditionally, these local peasants were subservient to the warrior nobles who owned the oasis and the land. The peasants tilled these fields, whose output they gave to the nobles after keeping a fifth part of the produce. Their Tuareg patrons were usually responsible for supplying agricultural tools, seed and clothing. The peasants\\' origins are also unclear. One theory postulates that they are descendants of ancient people who lived in the Sahara before they were dominated by invading groups. Some speak a Songhay dialect along with Tuareg and Arabic. In contemporary times, these peasant strata have blended in with freed black slaves and farm arable lands together.According to the historian Starratt, the Tuareg evolved a system of slavery that was highly differentiated. They established strata among their slaves, which determined rules as to the slave\\'s expected behavior, marriageability, inheritance rights if any, and occupation. The Ikelan later became a bonded caste within Tuareg society. According to Heath, the Bella in the Tuareg society were the slave caste whose occupation was rearing and herding livestock such as sheep and goats.\\n\\n\\n== West Africa ==\\n\\n\\n=== Fula people ===\\nThe Fula people are one of the largest and a widely dispersed Muslim ethnic group in Sahel and West Africa. They number between 20 and 25 million people in total across many countries of this region, and they have historically featured a caste system.The Fula caste system has been fairly rigid and has medieval roots. It was well established by the 15th-century, and it has survived into modern age. The four major castes, states Martin Kich, in their order of status are \"nobility, traders, tradesmen (such as blacksmiths) and descendants of slaves\". According to the African Commission on Human and Peoples\\' Rights, the Fulani people have held on to \"a strict caste system\".The upper caste consists of the nobles. Below these are the marabouts or clerics, then the cattle owning Fula people. Below all these are the artisan castes, which includes the blacksmiths, potters, griots, genealogists, woodworkers, and dressmakers. They belong to castes but are not enslaved and are free people.  Then there are those castes of captive, slave or serf ancestry: the Maccuɗo, Rimmayɓe, Dimaajo, and less often Ɓaleeɓe, the Fulani equivalent of the Tuareg Ikelan known as Bouzou (Buzu)/Bella in the Hausa and Songhay languages respectively.The Fulani castes are endogamous in nature, meaning individuals marry only within their caste. This caste system, however, wasn\\'t as elaborate in places like northern Nigeria, Eastern Niger or Cameroon. According to some estimates, by the late 19th century, slaves constituted about 50% of the population of the Fulɓe-ruled Adamawa Emirate, where they were referred to as jeyaɓe (singular jeyado). Though very high, these figures are representative of many other emirates of the Sokoto Caliphate, of which Adamawa formed a part. The castes-based social stratification among the Fula people was widespread and seen across the Sahel, such as Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan, and others.\\n\\n\\n=== Igbo people ===\\nThe Osu caste system in Nigeria and southern Cameroon of the Igbo people can be traced back to Odinani, the traditional Igbo religion. It is the belief of many Igbo traditionalists that the Osus are people historically owned by deities, and are therefore considered to be a \\'living sacrifice\\', an outcast, untouchable and sub-human (similar to the Roman practice of homo sacer). This system received literary attention when it became a key plot point in No Longer at Ease by Chinua Achebe.\\nPeople regarded as modern-day Osu in Igboland are descendants of individuals who volunteered and were sacrificed to the various gods. These fore-fathers pledged themselves and their descendants to these gods. They enjoyed protection and privileges but were segregated from ordinary folks. These Osu people married, fraternized and socialized among themselves. The practice continued to this day. An ordinary Igbo person would not marry or permit any of his relations to marry an Osu person. In a few instances where that has happened, every member of that non-Osu who married an Osu became infested and were regarded as Osu.\\nIt can be said that the only aspect of Igbo life that keeps the Osu segregation intact is marriage. An Osu could and could only marry a fellow Osu, and no more. It is a taboo and abhorrent for an Osu to marry a non-Osu - love or lust being immaterial.\\nSome suggest that due to the introduction of modernization, the Osu system is gradually leaving Igboland and tradition. The influence of Christianity (specifically Roman Catholicism) has caused Odinani to start slowly disappearing from Igboland. Obinna, in 2012, reports that in the Igbo community - especially in Enugu, Anambra, Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Edo and Delta states - Osu caste system remains a social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one\\'s birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into the Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.\\n\\n\\n=== Mande people ===\\nAmong the Mande societies in Mali, Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana, people are divided by occupation and ethnic ties. The highest hierarchy in the Mande caste system, the Horon (nobles/freeborn), are traditionally farmers, fisherman, warriors and animal breeders, the lowest caste are the Jonow, a \"slave\" caste, made up of people whose ancestors were enslaved by other Africans during wars. An important feature of this system are castes based on trade, such as blacksmiths and griots.\\n\\n\\n=== Mandinka people ===\\nThe Mandinka people are a West African ethnic group with an estimated population of eleven million with roots in western Sahel, in Mali, but now widely dispersed. Over 99% of Mandinka are Muslim.<The Mandinka people live primarily in West Africa, particularly in the Gambia  and the Guinea where they are the largest ethnic group. Major populations of the Mandinka people also live in Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Niger and Mauritania. Their traditional society has featured socially stratified castes, from at least the 13th century.The Mandinka society, states Arnold Hughes – a professor of West African Studies and African Politics, has been \"divided into three endogamous castes – the freeborn (foro), slaves (jongo), and artisans and praise singers (nyamolo). The freeborn castes are primarily farmers, while the slave strata included labor providers to the farmers, as well as leather workers, pottery makers, metal smiths, griots and others. The Mandinka Muslim clerics and scribes have traditionally been a separate endogamous occupational caste called Jakhanke, with their Islamic roots traceable to about the 13th-century.The Mandinka castes are hereditary, and marriages outside the caste was forbidden. Their caste system is similar to those of other ethnic groups of the African Sahel region, and found across the Mandinka communities such as those in Gambia, Mali, Guinea and other countries.\\n\\n\\n=== Senufo people ===\\nThe Senufo people are found in a region spanning the northern Ivory Coast, the southeastern Mali and the western Burkina Faso. One sub-group, the Nafana, is found in north-western Ghana.The Senufo people have traditionally been a socially stratified society that has included castes and slaves. These endogamous divisions are locally called Katioula, and one of the strata in this division includes slaves and descendants of slaves. According to Dolores Richter, the caste system found among Senufo people features \"hierarchical ranking including despised lower castes, occupational specificity, ritual complementarity, endogamy, hereditary membership, residential isolation and the political superiority of farmers over artisan castes\".\\n\\n\\n=== Soninke people ===\\nThe Soninke people are a West African ethnic group found in eastern Senegal and its capital Dakar, northwestern Mali and southern Mauritania. Predominantly Muslims, the Soninke were one of the early ethnic groups from Sub-Saharan West Africa to convert to Islam about the 10th century. The contemporary population of Soninke people is estimated to be over 2 million. The cultural practices of Soninke people are similar to the Mandé peoples, and includes social stratification. According to the anthropologist Tal Tamari, the Soninke society became highly stratified after the thirteenth century.The Soninke strata have included a free category called Horro or Horon, a caste system category called Namaxala or Nyaxamalo, and slaves called Komo. In the Jaara subgroup of the Soninke people, the nobility called Tunkanlenmu was another strata.The slaves were the largest strata, one at the bottom among the Soninke like other West African ethnic groups, and constituted up to half of the population. The slaves among the Soninke people were hierarchically arranged into three strata. The village slaves were a privileged servile group who lived apart from the village and took orders from the village chief. The domestic slaves lived in with a family and could not be sold. The lowest level among slaves were the trade slaves who could be bought and sold. With time, each of these strata became endogamous, states Daniel Littlefield – a professor of History.Above the slaves were the castes of Soninke, which too were hereditary, endogamous and had an embedded hierarchical status. They included, for example, the garanke (leather workers) below the fune (bard), the fune below the gesere or jeli (griots, singers), the jeli below the tage or numu (smiths, pottery workers).\\n\\n\\n=== Susu people ===\\nThe Susu people are a West African ethnic group, one of the Mandé peoples living primarily in Guinea. Influential in Guinea, smaller communities of Susu people are also found in the neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. The Susu are a patrilineal society, predominantly Muslim, who favor endogamous cross-cousin marriages with polygynous households common. They have a caste system like all Manding-speaking peoples of West Africa, where the artisans such as smiths, carpenters, musicians, jewelers and leatherworkers are separate castes, and believed to have descended from the medieval era slavery.The Susu people, like other Manding-speaking peoples, have a caste system regionally referred to by terms such as Nyamakala, Naxamala and Galabbolalauba. According to David Conrad and Barbara Frank, the terms and social categories in this caste-based social stratification system of Susu people shows cases of borrowing from Arabic only, but the likelihood is that these terms are linked to Latin, Greek or Aramaic.The artisans among Susu people such as smiths, carpenters, musicians and bards (Yeliba), jewelers and leatherworkers are separate castes. The Susu people believe that these castes have descended from the medieval era slaves. The Susu castes are not limited to Guinea, but are found in other regions where Susu people live, such as in Sierra Leone where too they are linked to the historic slavery system that existed in the region, states Daniel Harmon. The Susu castes in the regional Muslim communities were prevalent and recorded by sociologists in late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\n\\n\\n=== Temne people ===\\nThe Temne people are a West African ethnic group. They are predominantly found in the northwestern and central parts of Sierra Leone, as well as the national capital Freetown. Some Temne are also found in Guinea. The Temne constitute the largest ethnic group in Sierra Leone, at 35% of the total population. Temne society consists of patrilineal clans, is predominantly a mix of Muslim and polytheists, and some clans feature castes.The artisans and musicians in the Temne society have been endogamous caste people. The terminology of this social stratification system and the embedded hierarchy may have been adopted among the Temne from the nearby Mandinka people, Fula people and Susu people. The caste hierarchy and social stratification has been more well established in the northern Islamic parts of Temne territories. The endogamous slave castes were held in Temne clans as agriculture workers and domestic servants, and they formed the lowest subservient layer of the social strata. Enslaved women served as domestic workers, wives and concubines.\\n\\n\\n=== Toucouleur people ===\\nThe Toucouleur people are a Muslim West African ethnic group found mostly in Futa Toro region of Senegal, with some in Mali and Mauritania. The Toucouleur embraced Islam in the 11th century, their early and strong Islamic heritage is a matter of great pride for them. They have been influential in the spread of Islam to West Africa in the medieval era, later founded the vast Tukulor Empire in the 19th century under Umar Tal that led a religious war against their neighboring ethnic groups and the French colonial forces. The Toucouleur society has been patrilineal, polygynous and with high social stratification that included slavery and caste system.Toucouleur society is divided into strict and rigid caste hierarchies.The highest status among the five Toucouleur castes is of the aristocratic leaders and Islamic scholars called Torobe. Below them are the Rimbe, or the administrators, traders and farmers. The Nyenbe are the artisan castes of the Toucouleur society. The fourth caste strata is called the Gallunkobe or the slaves or descendants of slaves \"who have been freed\". The bottom strata among the Toucouleurs are the Matyube or slaves. The slaves were acquired by raiding pagan ethnic groups or purchased in slave markets, or the status was inherited.The hierarchical social stratification has been an economically closed system, which historically has meant a marked inequality. Property and land has been exclusively owned by the upper caste members. Occupations and caste memberships are inherited. The Toucouleur castes have been endogamous, segregated and intermarriage has been rare. The clerics among Toucouleur like the Wolof people formed a separate group. The religious leaders were not necessarily endogamous nor an inherited post in Toucouleur people\\'s long history, but it has been rare for lower caste people to become religious specialist, states Rüdiger Seesemann, as they were viewed as not sufficiently adhering to the \"clerical standards of piety\".\\n\\n\\n=== Wolof people ===\\nThe Wolof people are a West African Muslim ethnic group found in northwestern Senegal, The Gambia, and southwestern coastal Mauritania. In Senegal, the Wolof are the largest ethnic group (~ 39%), and their combined population exceeds 6 million. The Wolof people, like other West African ethnic groups, have historically maintained a rigid, endogamous social stratification that included nobility, clerics, castes and slaves. The Wolof caste system has existed at least since the 15th-century.The social strata have included a free category called geer, a castes category called nyeenyo or neeno, and a servile category of slaves called jaam. Caste status has been hereditary, and endogamy among the men and women of a particular caste status has been an enduring feature among the Wolof people, states Leonardo Villalón – a professor of Political Science and African Studies. The Wolof\\'s caste status, states Villalón, has been and is a greater barrier to inter-marriage than is either ethnicity or religion in Senegal.The castes have also been hierarchal, with lowest level being those of griots. Their inherited inferiority has been culturally stated to be close to those of slaves (jaams or kaals). The castes, states David Gamble, were associated with ideas of relative purity-impurity. The leatherworkers, for example, were considered the lowest of the nyenyo because their occupation involving animal skins was considered dirty.Slaves have historically been a separate, endogamous group in the Wolof society. Slavery was either inherited by birth in the Wolof society, or were kidnapped, purchased as children from desperate parents during difficult times such as a famine, or slavery was imposed by the village elders as a punishment for offenses. By the early 18th-century, all sorts of charges and petty crimes resulted in the accused being punished to the slave strata. Slaves acquired by kidnapping, purchase or as captives of war were called jaam sayor in the Wolof society.The geer or \"freeborn\" too had a hierarchical structure. At the top were the royal rulers, below them were the regionally or locally powerful noble lineages who controlled territories and collected tribute, and below them were commoner freeborn called the baadoolo or \"lacking power\".\\n\\n\\n=== Zarma people ===\\nThe Zarma people are an ethnic group predominantly found in westernmost Niger also found in significant numbers in the adjacent areas of Nigeria and Benin, along with smaller numbers in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Ghana. The Zarma people are predominantly Muslims of the Maliki-Sunni school, and they live in the arid Sahel lands, along the Niger River valley which is a source of irrigation, forage for cattle herds, and drinking water. The Zarma people have had a history of slave and caste system, like many West African ethnic groups.The Zarma people have traditionally been a socially stratified society, like the Songhai people, featuring castes, state Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan, Tal Tamari and other scholars. According to the medieval and colonial era descriptions, their vocation has been hereditary, and each stratified group has been endogamous. The social stratification embedded slavery, wherein the lowest strata of the population inherited slavery, and second the Zima or priests and Islamic clerics had to be initiated but did not automatically inherit that profession, making the cleric strata a pseudo-caste. According to Ralph Austen – a professor emeritus of African history, the caste system among the Zarma people was not as well developed as the caste system historically found in the African ethnic groups further west to them.\\n\\nThe different strata of the Zarma-Songhai people have included the kings and warriors, the scribes, the artisans, the weavers, the hunters, the fishermen, the leather workers and hairdressers (Wanzam), and the domestic slaves (Horso, Bannye). Each caste reveres its own guardian spirit. Some scholars such as John Shoup list these strata in three categories: free (chiefs, farmers and herders), servile (artists, musicians and griots), and the slave class. The servile group were socially required to be endogamous, while the slaves could be emancipated over four generations. The highest social level, states Shoup, claim to have descended from king \"Sonni \\'Ali Ber\" and their modern era hereditary occupation has been Sohance (sorcerer). The traditionally free strata of the Zerma people have owned property and herds, and these have dominated the political system and governments during and after the French colonial rule. Within the stratified social system, the Islamic system of polygynous marriages is a part of the Zarma people tradition, with preferred partners being cross cousins, and a system of ritualistic acceptance between co-wives. This endogamy is similar to other ethnic groups in West Africa.\\n\\n\\n== Central Africa ==\\n\\n\\n=== Mandara people ===\\nThe Mandara people are a Central African Muslim ethnic group found in north Cameroon, northeastern Nigeria, and southeastern Chad. They have lived in the mountainous region and valleys north of the Benue River in Cameroon, converted to Islam sometime around the 16th century, and have long been a part of the Mandara Sultanate.The Mandara society developed into a socially stratified system, with Sultan and royalty, farmers, horse breeders, artisans, iron workers and smiths forming a distinct endogamous occupation-inheriting castes. The caste system among the Mandara people integrated the concept that the strata have innate pollution and therefore they are stigmatized, however there is no evidence that their Islamic belief integrated the differences between the socially differentiated castes in their society to have been divinely sanctioned. The Mandara people also featured an endogamous slave strata.\\n\\n\\n=== Toubou people ===\\nThe Toubou people are an Islamic ethnic group inhabiting northern Chad, southern Libya, northeastern Niger, and northwestern Sudan.The Toubou people, states Jean Chapelle – a professor of History specializing on Chadian ethnic groups, have been socially stratified with an embedded caste system. The three strata have consisted of the freemen with a right to own property, the artisanal castes and the slaves.The endogamous caste of Azza (or Aza) among Toubou have the artisanal occupations, such as metal work, leather work, pottery and tailoring, and they have traditionally been despised and segregated by other strata of the Toubou, much like the Hadahid caste in southeastern Chad among the Zaghawa people. Marriage between a member of the blacksmith caste and a member from a different strata of the Toubou people has been culturally unacceptable. The strata locally called Kamadja were the slaves. The language used by the Azza people is a variant of the Tebu language, but mutually intelligible.\\n\\n\\n=== Zaghawa people ===\\nThe Zaghawa people, also called Beri or Zakhawa, are a Central African Muslim ethnic group of eastern Chad and western Sudan, including Darfur. The Zaghawa are mentioned in classical Arabic language texts by Islamic historians and geographers. The century in which the Zaghawa people adopted Islam has been a subject of debate and little consensus, with estimates ranging from the 13th to the early 17th century.The Zaghawa society has been socially stratified and has included castes. The upper strata has been of nobles and warriors, below them have been the traders and merchants, below whom have been the artisan castes called the Hadaheed (or Hadahid). These castes have been endogamous, and their inherited occupations have included iron work, hunters, pottery, leatherwork and musicians such as drummers. The artisan work has traditionally been viewed within the Zaghawa society as dirty and of inferior status, being people from different pagan and Jewish roots who slowly assimilated into the Islamic society.The term \"blacksmith\" has been a derogatory term in Zaghawa culture, states Anne Haour – a professor of African Studies and Medieval Archaeology, and \"if born a blacksmith one will always be a blacksmith\". Non-blacksmith castes of Zaghawa neither eat nor associate with the blacksmith castes. The lowest strata has been the slaves. The social stratification and castes such as for the leatherworker strata within the Zaghawa people is similar to those found in nearby Fur people.\\n\\n\\n== Southern Africa ==\\n\\n\\n=== Merina people ===\\nThe Merina people are the largest ethnic group in Madagascar. They historically have had a highly stratified caste system. The Merina society emerged in the 15th century in the central high plateau region of Madagascar. Its society, like many ethnic groups in Africa, had two category of people, the free locally called the fotsy, and the serfs or mainty. These were divided into three strata: the Andriana (nobles), the Hova (freemen), and the lowest strata called Andevo (slaves).Each strata was hierarchically subdivided. The Andriana are divided into six sub-strata, for example, each had an inherited occupation, and were endogamous.The nineteenth century records show that Andevo or slaves were imported black Africans, and they constituted about a third of the Merina society. The Merina society sold highland slaves to both Muslim and European slave traders on Madagascar coast, as well as bought East African and Mozambique-sourced slaves from them for their own plantations between 1795 and 1895. Marriage and any sexual relations between the upper strata fotsy and the lower strata mainty were a taboo. According to a 2012 report by Gulnara Shahinian – the United Nation\\'s Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, the descendants of former slave castes continue to suffer in contemporary Madagascar Merina society, and inter-caste marriages continue to be socially ostracized.\\n\\n\\n== Chronology ==\\nThe caste systems in Africa have been linked to the a pre-developed trading network, invasions from North Africa and the Middle East after the 7th century, followed by a slavery system that targeted the pagans. According to Susan McIntosh – a professor of Anthropology specializing in African societies, archeological evidence shows that Arabs and Berbers had expanded and established an integrated sub-Saharan trade and transport network with West Africa, building upon the pre-existing trade routes through Western Sudan. This trade by 9th to 10th centuries, states McIntosh, included commodities and slaves. The reach of slave trading had extended into Ghana and the western Atlantic coast by the 11th century, and the slave raiding, capture, holding and trading systems became increasingly sophisticated in 13th and 14th century Mali Empire and 16th century Songhai Empire.As the practice of slavery grew, so did the caste system. Tamari suggests that a corollary of the rising slavery system was the development and growth of the caste system among numerous ethnic groups of Africa by about the 13th century. McIntosh concurs with Tamari\\'s reasoning approach, but disagrees with the dating. McIntosh states that the emergence of caste systems likely occurred much earlier in the West African societies such as Soninke, Mande, Malinke, Wolof, and others. She places the development and spread of castes in these societies to about the 10th-century, because the slave capture, slave trade and slave holding by elite families was an established institution in West Africa by then, and slavery created a template for servile relationships and social stratification of human beings.The linguistic evidence suggests that stratification structure and words relating to caste system and slavery likely were shared between the many ethnic groups, and possibly some others such as the Dogon people of West Africa. However, the linguistic differences between the caste and slave systems between Soninke and northern ethnic groups of Africa such as the Tuareg people and Moors suggests that these evolved separately.\\n\\n\\n== Comparison between castes of Africa and South Asia ==\\nLouis Dumont, the 20th-century author famous for his classic Homo Hierarchicus, recognized the social stratification among the ethnic groups in West Africa, but suggested that sociologists should invent a new term for West African social stratification system. Other scholars consider this a bias and isolationist because the West African system shares all elements in Dumont\\'s system, including economic, ritual, spiritual, endogamous, elements of pollution, segregative and spread over a large region. According to Anne Haour – a professor of African Studies, some scholars consider the historic caste-like social stratification among African communities to be a pre-Islam feature while some consider it derived from the Arab influence.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Bibliography ===\\nKarl G.

Chatin was born in a well-known family of trading traditions, in Shkodër, Albania. He was brought up with an occidental mentality in an environment of European cultural roots. This influence, seems to have helped him in covering for a short period of time, a diplomatic position in the High Administration of King Zog the First.\\nHis widow (Désirée) Elizabeth, whom he married on 5 December 1961, died on 2 November 2003.\\nChatin Sarachi\\'s marriage certificate states that he had been previously married but that that earlier marriage had been “annulled”.   It also appears from the marriage certificate that he was born in 1899. His father Gjok Saraçi is said to have been a landowner. On the other hand, family sources refer to Chatin\\'s father as a translator.\\nSarachi\\'s death certificate confirms 14 June 1899 as the date of his birth. He died on 27 November 1974.He was a close friend of John St Aubyn, 4th Baron St Levan.\\n\\n\\n== Sarachi as a painter ==\\n\\nChatin Sarachi first went to England on a diplomatic mission in 1933. In fact, the occupation of Albania from the Italian army coincides with Chatin\\'s position as First Secretary of the Albanian Embassy in London, where he became a well-known painter. Within a few years he had decided to remain in London and gave up his diplomatic career to concentrate on painting.\\nIn 1939 Sarachi met the great expressionist artist Oskar Kokoschka. Kokoschka became a close friend and admirer of Sarachi as well as a constant influence on his work. They shared a Kensington studio in Stratford Road, not far from the Pride Gallery, and worked together leaving as a witness of their friendship, many drawings and paintings of each other.\\nIn the press of that period, his name is mentioned among the best representatives of English Impressionism, including Oscar Kokoschka. The landscapes, the still lifes, and the flower paintings of Sarachi, exude a vibrant quality with a strictly personal use of colour and tone, achieved through his mastery of watercolors and pastels. In addition, his delicate line drawings indicate that Sarachi was also greatly influenced by Oriental art.\\nSarachi\\'s first personal exhibition was held in the aftermath of the Second World War (1945) at the Redfern Gallery, in London. In the folder advertising this exhibition there was written the phrase: \"The miracles can still happen in the slaughterhouse of agony, crime and corruption that best describes our world. This is the message that the paintings of Chatin Sarachi express.\"which we think to be very suitable to his work and personality\".\\n\\nOn the Catalogue of the exhibition, among other things, Kokoschka states:\\n\\n\"A contemporary painter with whom the larger public has not yet become acquainted does well to make his own decision of what he thinks the message, contained in his work, will be to those who are to greet him as the morning star.\\n\"In the oils and drawings exhibited by Chatin Sarachi here is the work of a former diplomat whom one mighty moment has blessed. Who, at a sudden, was reminded of the time when, as a child, he trod the rude shore and the bare ground of his native Albania.\"This first exhibition was followed by other two, in the mid fifties. A fourth, commemorating one, with fifty of his best paintings was opened in 1975. It included drawings, oil and water paintings, of landscapes, still lives, and several portraits. In the opening of this exhibition J.P. Hodin concludes with saying that Chatin Sarachi \" …was a very good friend, an elaborate artist and one of the most colourful personalities ever known. He liked the high life but, at the same time, was so introspective. He had great artistic ambitions but little interest in criticism\".\\nOver the years, Sarachi participated in several group shows and had regular one man exhibitions in London, Paris and Dublin.The last exhibition of his work was held at the Pride Gallery in London in 1988. Today, the work of Chatin is considered to be closely connected to Expressionism although his knowledge and appreciation included influences of  Japanese and Chinese painters. This influence can be noticed quite clearly in some of his masterpieces, as are the flower paintings.\\n\\n\\n== Sarachi as a politician ==\\nAlready, at a very early age, Sarachi was known to be a very close friend of the King. In communicating to Him (Zog), Chatin calls himself as:\" [Your] ex best friend\". It is this friendship that characterized the antagonistic, political arena of that time, to transform this Zog-Sarachi co-operation into an indissoluble and symbiotic relation and even to imply an unproved and shameful involvement of the name of Chatin Sarachi in Luigj Gurakuqi\\'s murderer.Sarachi, among his many writings, left a statement about the King Ahmet Zog the First, published in Albania in the year 2006. \\nThe typewriting entitled: ”The story of a bad man”,  was left in the safe of a bank in London, from where it has been taken and translated into Albanian.In his writings, Sarachi, among other things, speaking to King Zog, states:\\n\\n\"Your callings about our old friendship show that your conscience and its nibbles are at work.\\nIndependently from your legal business, you began your reign by killing patriots and by selling your own country.\\nAlessandro Lessona (Minister of Mussolini\\'s government), a friend of mine at the time, paid to you more than 4 million English Pounds from 1925 to 1931. Even I had the right to act, I never asked for my part. That money, as anyone in Albania knows, has been washed by the blood of patriots like Bajram Curri, Hasan Prishtina, Luigj Gurakuqi and thousands of them.\\nThe money you are living with today, is the product of the lowest betrayal and is washed by the tears and the suffering of a whole nation, the nation you sold, you Albanian Judas!\\nI know each dark corner of your soul, not a single event of your reign that I ignore.\\nFrom your cottage in the mountains, where you were born, you came to live in luxurious castles around Europe.\\nBut the nibbling of your conscience that twice brought you so close to the grave, still lives with you in the luxurious rooms.\\n\\nYour gunned gangsters can protect your body but, for sure, they cannot protect you dark and poor soul. The friends and enemies you have ordered to kill still flatter around you night and day wherever you try to go. The shadows of more than 1 million chained Albanians run after you, calling your name. Thousand of Albanians dead, for the freedom of their country, cannot leave you alone.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nChatin Sarachi\\'s website\\n'], ['Cloghanmore', 'Monuments_and_memorials', 'Cloghanmore is a megalithic chamber tomb of the court tomb (or court cairn) type located about 8 km east from Carrick in Malin More, Glencolmcille, in County Donegal, Ireland.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\nThe tomb is oriented east to west, with the main entrance located on the eastern end.

In 1662 the Borough of Leeds received a new charter which created the office of mayor, and the arms (the shield alone) seems to date from about this time as they incorporate part of the arms of the first mayor. These arms were recorded at the heraldic visitation of Yorkshire in 1666. By the time that the borough was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, silver owls had been added both as crest above the shield, and as supporters on either side. These additions were not authorised, however, and in 1920 application was made by Leeds County Borough Council to the College of Arms to have these additions officially granted. In the following year the grant of crest and supporters was made, with the colouring of the owls altered to \"proper\", or natural colourings. Gold ducal coronets were added to the supporters for further heraldic difference.In 1974, the county borough was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of a much larger Metropolitan District of Leeds.

This monopoly caused jealousy among merchants who did not subscribe to it and in 1635 King Charles I granted a trading license to Sir William Courteen under the name of the Courteen association permitting it also to trade with the east at any location in which the East India Company had no presence. Courteen's fellow promoters included Endymion Porter, groom of the King's bedchamber and Sir Francis Windebank, his Secretary of State.The company had a troubled beginning, it was badly managed, lost ships at sea and suffered a collapse in 1636, after which Courteen fled to the continent where he died.During the English civil war the Crown gave its support to the Courteen association and badly treated the East India merchants, causing them to generally support Parliament. In 1649 the Courteen Association changed its name to the Assada company.The enmity between the two trading organisations continued until a settlement was ordered by Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector and the two merged in 1657.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of trading companies\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nMehta, Jaswant Lal (2005).

The character is depicted as a cyborg and is commonly an enemy of the X-Men.\\nThe character was portrayed by Boyd Holbrook in the 2017 film Logan.\\n\\n\\n== Publication history ==\\nDonald Pierce first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men #132 April 1980, and was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Pierce\\'s name and appearance were modeled by Byrne upon Donald Sutherland. The character\\'s last name comes from Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, Sutherland\\'s character in the 1970 film M*A*S*H.\\n\\n\\n== Fictional character biography ==\\nDonald Pierce was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He first appears as a high-ranking member of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, where he holds the position of White Bishop. However, Pierce is in fact a genocidal mutant hater, and has only joined the Hellfire Club in order to kill the Inner Circle\\'s other members, all of whom are mutants. In addition to hating mutants, Pierce is also bigoted towards certain nationalities and harbors a sense of self-loathing due to his cyborg status, referring to himself as \"only half a man\". He is the CEO and principal shareholder of Pierce-Consolidated Mining, and operates out of a mining and laboratory complex in Cameron, Kentucky. Pierce and his mercenaries kidnap Professor X and Tessa in a plot against the Hellfire Club and X-Men, but he is defeated by the Professor despite a device shielding against telepathic attacks. Pierce is handed over to Tessa of the Hellfire Club, expelled from the Inner Circle, and taken to a secret holding facility in one of Shaw Industries\\' Kentucky installations.\\n\\n\\n=== The Reavers ===\\nMany months later, Pierce is violently liberated from the holding facility. Though his rescuers are never explicitly identified, he resurfaces alongside three members of the Reavers, a band of cyborg criminals which Pierce claims to have built and assembled, and which had recently been all but wiped out by the X-Men. The four of them ally with Lady Deathstrike and three Hellfire Club mercenaries (Cole, Macon, and Reese) who were cybernetically enhanced by Pierce. Under Pierce\\'s leadership, the new Reavers are dedicated to exterminating mutants, with highest priority given to the X-Men and Sebastian Shaw (CEO of Shaw Industries).The Reavers take over the X-Men\\'s headquarters in their absence, but after the X-Men leave through the Siege Perilous, they manage to capture only Wolverine whom they torture and crucify. During this time, Pierce develops a romantic attraction towards Lady Deathstrike but the woman is disgusted by Pierce\\'s arrogance and spurns him, and Wolverine is rescued by Jubilee and the two mutants go into hiding. Pierce tracks the two down, but is incapacitated by Jubilee. Assuming the mutants fled to Muir Island, Pierce and the Reavers attack Muir Island, and battle Moira MacTaggart\\'s \"Muir Island X-Men\" and Freedom Force. With the Reavers, he also attacks Frost Technologies\\' plant in California. Pierce creates two super intelligent sentient androids (Elsie-Dee and Albert), programming the two to find Wolverine and self-destruct. However, the androids\\' intelligence allows the two to put the bomb in Elsie-Dee on hold, and abandon the Reavers.The Upstarts\\' members Trevor Fitzroy sends reprogrammed Sentinels to destroy the Reavers, as they are a threat to mutants and the former White King is worth a lot of \"points\" in the deadly game the Upstarts play. Only Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape. Pierce has Gateway teleport him to the one responsible for the attack on the Reavers, but the Sentinels accompanying Fitzroy to electrocute him. Despite his seeming demise, he later resurfaces, starts an anti-mutant hate group, and enlists several members; revealing a plot to take militant terrorist actions against mutants and thwarted by the X-Men, he is beaten by Wolverine in hand-to-hand combat. Very little of Pierce\\'s human tissue remains, which explains how he was able to survive the massacre in Australia with only portions of his upper torso intact.Pierce would remain with the Hellfire Club for some time, eventually showing a more adversarial relationship with Shaw as the current Black King. He heads out to an outpost in Switzerland believed to be the immortal tyrant Apocalypse\\'s old stronghold, in order to obtain the first mutant\\'s power and technological marvels, also to secure his position within the Hellfire Club\\'s inner circle. In one such botched expedition involving the mutant time traveler Cable, he was believed to be flash incinerated when he, Shaw and a guide leading them through another of the first mutant\\'s lairs unleashed a techno-organic entity created by the mutant overlord in the past. All managed to survive unscathed, save for Pierce himself whose injuries further cost him much of his remaining flesh, revealing his head to be his only remaining fully organic component. Due to his constant failures and Shaw\\'s general contempt of him, Pierce is eventually cut loose from the Inner Circle, left to plummet to his death from an escaping helicopter. Ironically enough he would later find refuge in one of Cable\\'s old safe-houses, whose futuristic resources and databases he would use in reconstructing his damaged body, making himself a new cybernetic shell out of solid Adamantium he stole from another cyborg\\'s secret cache. When Logan and Jubilee happened upon his machinations thanks to Gateway, the two were able to preempt whatever plans he had alongside Khyber, the mysterious cyborg whose Adamantium reserves Pierce stole, who had intervened.Pierce later re-emerges, employing cyborgs Pico, Lady Deathstrike, and Skullbuster in an attempt to abduct Milo Thurman (Domino\\'s estranged husband) from his US government holding facility. As Thurman has the genius ability to predict future events accurately from current data, Pierce wishes to integrate Thurman into his cybernetic brain so he may use this ability to exert further control of the world\\'s future. Pierce reveals that after the events involving Fitzroy at the Hellfire Club, his mind and body were restored by a mysterious benefactor, and he now has a new prime directive. Just as Pierce downloads Thurman\\'s mind into his own, Domino destroys Pierce\\'s appropriated Weapon X base. Domino escapes, but Pierce and Thurman both seemingly perish in the ensuing explosion.\\n\\n\\n=== As a Purifier ===\\nPierce next tries to take over Sebastian Shaw\\'s new Hellfire Club, launching an attack and slashing Shaw\\'s chest. Though Shaw is left critically injured and later needed to be hospitalized, Shaw is able to punch off Pierce\\'s head. Pierce later is forcibly recruited into the Purifiers\\' ranks and infected with the Technarch transmode virus. Being under the control of the mutant-hunting robot Bastion, he shows his mutant target: the newly formed Young X-Men.\\n\\n\\n=== Young X-Men ===\\nHe appears in a nightmare of the precognitive mutant Blindfold, battling a not yet formed team of X-Men and killing one of their number. Pierce himself recruited this team using an image inducer to pose as Cyclops (the X-Men\\'s leader). His reasons for recruiting these mutants as \"X-Men\" are not entirely clear, however, it appears that his primary focus is to eliminate the Hellfire Club\\'s current Lord Imperial Roberto da Costa and former New Mutants allies. He also hires Ink to deliver Dani and Blindfold to him, misleading him. Following the confrontation with the Young X-Men, his face is scoured by Dust.With face\\'s synthetic skin restored, he is kept captive by the Young X-Men. Ink is allowed to stay on the team and despite contention from Rockslide, later apologizes to Blindfold for working for Pierce, who remains in X-Men captivity. Pierce and Dust have frequent conversations while he is imprisoned, despite his vocal hatred of mutants and derogatory remarks toward Dust\\'s faith in Islam, noting that his attitude reminds Dust of home. While they talk, Dust admits to Pierce of dying, as he is \"the only one who won\\'t care\" and he agrees to share with Dust the secret information he has about teammates. He tells Dust that Ink is the mystery \"non-mutant\" among them, which is later discovered by the rest of the team. Also, he subtly says that three will die soon, referring to Boom Boom, Hellion and Surge, who were captured by the Sapien League and injected with a strain of the Legacy Virus.\\n\\n\\n=== Second Coming ===\\nIt was eventually revealed that Pierce was only captured to act as Bastion\\'s mole inside the X-Men\\'s headquarters, all the while building several structures that surround Utopia.Later after receiving the green light from Bastion to proceed with their plan, Pierce provokes an explosion that decimates all the X-Men\\'s jets and the Blackbirds. Pierce stands amid the debris, and muses to the X-Men that he is sorry that he will not live to witness the decimation of the mutant race. Cyclops eliminates him with an optic blast.\\n\\n\\n=== Uncanny Avengers ===\\nDonald was seen alive again with the rest of the Hellfire Club\\'s Inner Circle on a pleasure cruise reserved for super criminals and cabals. He along with his compatriots were seen at a gambling den aboard the vessel as the Avengers Unity Division were searching for The Red Skull across the world.\\n\\n\\n=== Hunt for Wolverine ===\\nShortly after his return as seen during the \"Hunt for Wolverine\" storyline, Pierce and the Reavers were left in dire straits since they failed a couple of jobs as a unit. Worn down and nearly broken by hard times the cyborg posse took up one last job in order to earn enough cash for a total refit - exhuming the grave for the deceased Wolverine. They were disappointed to find that Logan\\'s body had been removed from the Adamantium casing after Cylla Markham had cracked it open using a Molecular Rearranger, to which after a lengthily battle with the X-Men, Pierce and the others were rounded up and deposited into the care of Alpha Flight, as their attempt at grave robbery happened upon Canadian soil.\\n\\n\\n=== O*N*E Conscription ===\\nDue to lack of resources and proper jurisdiction however, Pierce and the rest of the Reavers were eventually turned over to the Office of National Emergency. The mutant related activity hating General Robert Callahan had Pierce run a couple of missions for the mutant crimes task force bureau on the false promise of freedom and much-needed system overhauls. With the latest acquisition of Miss Sinister however, General Callahan revealed the duplicity by triggering remote fail-safes installed during the Reavers\\' refitting. Pierce and select members of his crew were forced to impart their technologies and mechanical skills into building up Callahan\\'s mutant-hunting gear, the rest of whom had been given the kill order by the corrupt commander to his soldiers, an event which soon made public news and garnered the attention of some ragtag X-Men.After many of these mutants had been captured on live television, the remains of Pierce\\'s cyborg crew, led by leftover mutant heroes Havok and Warpath, launched an assault on the Location 22 base camp of O*N*E withholding and experimenting on their friends. Where it is revealed that the list of mutant targets Callahan had the Reavers go after were the likely holders of what was the last component needed to upgrade the Sentinel Squad One unit. Havok, having had it in possession since the moral inversion, traded it for the Reavers\\' help, learning too late that the final piece was a nanite-coded module fashioned by Bastion that enables any machine to adaptively assimilate and incorporate any new technology into themselves.A deadly new modification which Pierce\\'s forces put to horrifying use as they assimilated the Squad Sentinels, turning them into new bodies for their penultimate use. With the ultimate augmentation in tow, Pierce and the now giant mech-upgraded Reavers move out to attack the X-Mansion, showing off their extravagant Technomorphing upgrades as they take and receive damage in battle. But they are soon undone by the mutants they believed to have double-crossed and destroyed back at the 22 base. Dazzler, after having absorbed Sean\\'s shriek after the latter had nanotech parasitically hot-wired by Skullduster, let out a massive photokinetic pulse blast which stunned the Reavers and totalled their Sentinel bodies, putting them down for the count. Eventually O*N*E would show up taking both Havok and the Reavers back into their custody.During the \"Iron Man 2020\" event, Albert was directed by Tyger Tiger to Reavers Universal Robotics (Pierce\\'s company) in Madripoor and is confronted by Bonebreaker and the Reavers. Pierce arrives to prevent the lobby from being wrecked. Taking Albert on a tour, Pierce states that he has been upgrading his operations with the help of a 3D Printer. When Pierce stated that Elsie-Dee is not here and that previously appearing asking to have the self-destruct mechanism disarmed, Albert retaliates while claiming that Pierce doesn\\'t own the two androids. After Albert subdues the Reavers, Pierce states having sold Elsie-Dee\\'s head to yakuza boss Kimura, the arms to the Jade Dragon Triad, and the legs to the Vladivostok Mafia. After Albert heads out, Bonebreaker reports that some toxic fumes escaped from the air lock and advises to put a respirator on as Pierce plans to put a suffering chip in Albert\\'s head. After getting the parts from them, Albert puts Elsie-Dee back together. In light of Albert\\'s actions towards them, the Reavers, Kimura, the Jade Dragon Triad, and the Vladivostok Mafia to take action against Albert vowing that Albert will never make it out of Madripoor alive. In downtown Madripoor, Pierce and the Reavers are traveling through the vacant streets as they state that Albert and Elsie-Dee will have to travel through the Vladivostok Mafia\\'s turf before they can engage them. Arriving at Madripoor Airport, the Reavers cover all the entrances there to make sure Albert and Elsie-Dee do not leave Madripoor. The Reavers bring a high velocity railgun in. During Albert and Elsie-Dee\\'s fight with Kimura\\'s men, Kimura stops the attack and informs Albert and Elsie-Dee about the ambush. As Kimura\\'s limousine fools the Reavers into thinking that Albert and Elsie-Dee hijacked it and fire the railgun on it, Kimura smuggles Albert and Elsie-Dee out of Madripoor in a box claiming that it is filled with slot machine parts bound for Macao. The Reavers check the limousine wreckage and find that Albert and Elsie-Dee are not there.\\n\\n\\n== Powers and abilities ==\\nDonald Pierce is a cyborg originally with four artificial limbs which provide him with superhuman strength. His speed, reflexes and agility are also inhumanly high. Attributes derived from his replacement extremities. His body has great resistance to damage and even if it is destroyed, as long as his head is intact he will probably survive. Before and after securing some of Cable\\'s technology from the future and incorporating it into himself, he boasted a wide cadre of skills and abilities, such as generating a shocking plasma current through his cyborg limbs or hurling it as electrical force over short distances. His bionic body once hosted adamantium as an outer shell which further bolstered his resistance to damage. He also boasts bionic optics which feed into his Technarch mind in order to memorize and relay information, giving him an eidetic memory and photography vision. Pierce can plastically morph his arms into weapons like skeins, cannons, pincers, finger missiles and razor claws; likely through nanotechnology. His elongated nails can channel the electrical energies he generates into them increasing his cutting edge.There is nothing left of his original human body, save for his head, which was given fake flesh and bone structural appearance through a synthetic skin hiding a robotic skull underneath. As such he is immune to psionic infraction thanks to various brain implants for telepathic resistance, also having the ability to turn psionic assaults against the attacker to a limited degree. He also boasted rocket powered flight capabilities, enabling Pierce to fly at unknown speeds for prolonged extents of time. He also has an Image Inducer to disguise himself with, used for infiltration purposes like moving undercover through the Xavier Institute as Cyclops for a time. He even boasts a personal teleporter device of his own design for quick escapes. It is unknown if he still has his original brain or if he uploaded his memories, intelligence, and thought engrams into a cyborg computer brain. As a member of the Reavers, he often wore body armor.During his indoctrination into Bastion\\'s Purifiers Donald was also modified with a Transmode Virus infection that made him subservient to the killer A.I.\\'s command code. While he hasn\\'t shown any mechamorphing abilities of the Technarch, he has shown the ability to simulate Scott\\'s optic blast power while disguised as him. Aside from his physical advantages, Donald Pierce is a genius in robotics, cybernetics and electronics. In these fields he has developed technology that exceeds that of conventional science by approximately two centuries. He is also a seasoned leader with vast financial and human resources (a prerequisite for membership in the Hellfire Club). He is a college graduate in geological engineering and business administration, and is an accomplished strategist and business administrator. Pierce is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, but mainly relies on his cyborg strength and is more prone to letting others fight his battles for him rather than fight on the front lines. In later publishing after coming under the services of the Office of National Emergency, Pierce as with all of his Reavers gained the ability to cyperpathically possess and/or assimilate any piece of engineered conveyance he can get his hands on. Effectively rebuilding and bulking himself up from any and every automated fabrication around him, I.E. commandeering a Sentinel for a new body or turning a truck into an arm cannon.\\n\\n\\n== Other versions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Age of Apocalypse ===\\nIn the Age of Apocalypse, Pierce was the leader of the Reavers, a band of human assassins enhanced by Apocalypse\\'s techno-organic virus. Thanks to the virus, Pierce and his band of assassins become cyborgs with regenerative abilities and the power to assimilate both organic and non-organic material to mutate themselves. Pierce infiltrated the territory of the Human High Council in an attempt to destroy the Council fleet and later attempted to kill Gateway, an ally of the HHC. After the fleet was assembled for an attack on Apocalypse\\'s empire, Pierce infected Carol Danvers with the remains of the Reaver Vultura to aid him in the destruction of the fleet. During his attack he also used Brian Braddock, who was under Apocalypse\\'s mind control, to kill Emma Frost, though he resisted Pierce\\'s orders, for which Pierce killed him. In the end, Pierce was destroyed by Weapon X.A human team known only as X-Terminators had used Pierce\\'s blood sample before he was infected by the techno-organic virus to create several clones of him in order to help the fight against the mutants. One such clone began operating under the codename \"Goodnight\" and infiltrated the Hellfire Club, becoming a great friend of Sebastian Shaw. The general public and Club members think he is in fact a mutant.\\n\\n\\n=== House of M ===\\nIn the House of M, Donald was a member of the Human Liberation Front, one of the many human resistance groups labeled as terrorists by the House of M. Alongside Seiji Ashida, the father of Surge, he was part of the HLF\\'s base in Tokyo, which had targeted Project Genesis, a plan of Emperor Sunfire to forcefully mutate baseline humans.\\n\\n\\n== In other media ==\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\nDonald Pierce appears in the X-Men animated series. As seen in the episodes \"The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 1): Dazzled\" and \"The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 2): The Inner Circle\", he is depicted as much younger than his comics counterpart.\\nDonald Pierce appears in the Wolverine and the X-Men animated series. This version, instead of a mutant-hating cyborg, is a mutant capable of emitting energy blasts. In the episodes \"Shades of Grey\", \"Foresight (Part 1)\", \"Foresight (Part 2)\" and \"Foresight (Part 3)\", he is shown as part of the Inner Circle.\\n\\n\\n=== Film ===\\nDonald Pierce appears in the 2017 film Logan, portrayed by Boyd Holbrook. Taking Kimura\\'s place as Laura\\'s handler, the version of the character is Zander Rice\\'s chief of security for Transigen with a cybernetic right arm and claims to be a \"fan\" of Logan. After finding Gabriela Lopez and Laura, Pierce kidnaps Caliban to track Logan, Laura and Charles Xavier. Pierce survives Caliban\\'s suicide by grenade then uses a fleet of drones to find the gathering place of Laura and other mutant children who are trying to escape to Canada. The children kill or incapacitate several of the Reavers, then combine their powers to kill him.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDonald Pierce at Marvel.com\\nDonald Pierce at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\\nCerebra\\'s files: Donald Pierce\\n'], ['Downwash', 'Building', \"In aeronautics, downwash is the change in direction of air deflected by the aerodynamic action of an airfoil, wing or helicopter rotor blade in motion, as part of the process of producing lift.

His first appearance was in The Flash #112 (February 25, 1960).Elongated Man has appeared in The CW\\'s live-action Arrowverse television series The Flash, portrayed by Hartley Sawyer.\\n\\n\\n== Publication history ==\\nThe Elongated Man was created by writer John Broome and penciler Carmine Infantino, with significant input from editor Julius Schwartz, who wanted a new supporting character for the Flash. Julius Schwartz has noted that the Elongated Man was only created because he had not realized that Plastic Man was available due to character rights having been obtained by DC in 1956 (along with other Quality Comics properties). However, Infantino and inker Murphy Anderson stated that he never used him as a reference for anything.In his 2000 autobiography, The Amazing World of Carmine Infantino, the artist wrote, \"I really liked Elongated Man because it was comical and I enjoyed drawing comedy. It was also one of my favorite strips, because it was as close to animation as I could do in a comic book. I liked being able to test the limits of the comic book form and this strip allowed me to do that.\"The Elongated Man received a solo backup feature in Detective Comics, where he was redefined as a detective who loves odd mysteries and travels the United States in a convertible with his wife, searching for them. Sometimes they would travel the world or meet other DC superheroes like Batman, Green Lantern, the Atom and Zatanna. This feature became sporadic during the late \\'60s and throughout the \\'70s. However, in 1973, he became a member of the Justice League of America, and he is mostly seen in that title from 1973 to 1995.\\n\\n\\n== Fictional character biography ==\\nAs a teenager, Ralph Dibny was fascinated by contortionists, or people who displayed feats of agility and suppleness. He learned that all of the body-benders he spoke with drank a popular soda called \"Gingold\". Ralph set to work learning chemistry and developed a super-concentrated extract of the rare \"gingo\" fruit of the Yucatan, which gave him his elasticity. In his first appearance, the Flash suspects the Elongated Man is behind several crimes, but the Elongated Man helps capture the criminals, who reveal they used a helicopter to frame him.Ralph Dibny was one of the earliest Silver Age DC heroes to reveal his secret identity to the public, and also one of the first to marry his love interest. After teaming up with several other superheroes like Batman, Green Lantern, the Atom, Zatanna and the Justice League of America, he became a member of the team. Eventually, his wife became a member as well. The couple was also notable in having a stable, happy, and relatively trouble-free marriage—an anomaly in the soap operatic annals of superhero comic books.\\n\\n\\n=== Identity Crisis ===\\n\\nRalph Dibny played a central role in the events of Identity Crisis, with the main arc of the series revolving around the DC Universe\\'s response to the murder of Sue Dibny.  The healthy, stable relationship between Ralph and Sue, and the events that led to and resulted from her death, were used as primary narrative devices throughout the series for examining the respective personal relationships of other JLA and JSA members (and to a lesser extent, members of the supervillain community).\\nThe effect of Sue\\'s death on Ralph (compounded by the fact that Sue was apparently pregnant at the time of her death) would come to shape his character significantly in the events following Identity Crisis, eventually culminating at the end of the weekly series 52.\\nRalph and Sue appeared as members of the Justice League offshoot the Super Buddies in the miniseries Formerly Known as the Justice League and its sequel story arc \"I Can\\'t Believe It\\'s Not The Justice League\" published in JLA: Classified #4-9. The latter arc was produced before Identity Crisis, but published afterwards. A running joke in \"I Can\\'t Believe It\\'s Not The Justice League\" involves the possibility of Sue\\'s pregnancy.\\n\\n\\n=== 52 ===\\n\\nIn the 2006 weekly series 52, a grief-stricken Ralph Dibny is contemplating suicide when he is informed that Sue\\'s gravestone has been vandalized with an inverted version of Superman\\'s \\'S\\' symbol—the Kryptonian symbol for resurrection. He confronts Cassandra Sandsmark, and she tells Dibny that she is in a cult that believes that Superboy can be resurrected. She steals Ralph\\'s wedding ring after the cult members try to drown Ralph.During Week 11, after scaring some cult members and chasing them off, he gets a report that someone broke into a storage container in Opal City and stole Sue\\'s clothes. In Week 12, Ralph finds Wonder Girl and she tells him they stole the clothes and ring to make a Sue dummy. She invites him to the ceremony.During Week 13, Ralph goes to the ceremony. Metamorpho, the Green Arrow, Zauriel, and Hal Jordan come with him. Despite his initial agreement, Dibny and his friends disrupt the ceremony, but the effigy of Sue crawls to Dibny and calls out to him as it burns; Dibny suffers a nervous breakdown as a result.During Week 18, other members of the Croatoan Society (Detective Chimp, Terri Thirteen, and Edogawa Sangaku) find Tim Trench dead with the helmet of Doctor Fate, Nabu. Ralph comes to investigate and asks for help from the Shadowpact, Detective Chimp\\'s other group. A voice from within the helm of Doctor Fate, unheard by the other members of the group, speaks to Dibny and promises to fulfill his desires if he makes certain sacrifices. Dibny journeys with the helm through the afterlives of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic.During Week 27, the Spectre promises to resurrect Sue in exchange for Dibny\\'s taking vengeance on Jean Loring, but Dibny is unable to do so.During Week 32, Ralph ventures to Nanda Parbat and gets into a fight with the Yeti. The Perfect Accomplished Physician comes to the rescue. Both he and the Yeti are members of the Great Ten, defenders of China. At Nanda Parbat, Rama Kushna tells Dibny, \"The end is already written\".During week 42, Dibny is in Dr. Fate\\'s tower. He begins the spell to resurrect Sue, puts on the helmet of Fate, and shoots it, revealing Felix Faust, who was posing as Nabu. Faust planned to trade Dibny\\'s soul to Neron in exchange for his own freedom. Ralph reveals that he was aware of Faust\\'s identity for some time, and that the binding spell surrounding the tower is designed to imprison Faust, not to counter any negative effects of the spell.  Neron appears and kills Dibny, only to realize too late that the binding spell responds only to Dibny\\'s commands: through his death, Ralph has trapped Faust and Neron in the tower, seemingly for all eternity, though his methods of doing so are unknown. His spirit is later seen reunited with his wife. However, Neron is able to escape almost immediately. During the Black Adam: The Dark Ages miniseries, Faust is shown to escape with the help of Black Adam and a resurrected Isis, who is under Faust\\'s mental control. These events take place just prior to Countdown, indicating that Faust had only been there for a few weeks.At the end of Week 52, it is revealed that Dibny\\'s magical, wish-granting gun (a souvenir from \"the Anselmo Case\", a reference to The Life Story of the Flash) worked——Ralph\\'s last wish was to be reunited with his wife, even in death——and that Ralph and Sue are now reunited as ghost detectives, investigating a school where a paranormal phenomenon has just occurred.\\n\\n\\n=== One Year Later ===\\n\\nIn Blue Beetle #16, Traci 13 mentioned that she had been taken in by Ralph and Sue after her mother died.\\nIn the 2007-08 Black Adam miniseries Dark Ages, it is shown that Ralph\\'s remains are still inside Fate\\'s Tower when Teth-Adam asks Faust if his deal to trick Dibny had worked. Ralph\\'s skeleton is used by Faust to create the illusion that Adam\\'s attempt at resurrecting Isis had failed.\\nIn Batman and the Outsiders (vol. 2) #5, it is revealed (after appearing unknown in the previous two issues) that Ralph and Sue have gained or discovered the ability to possess human bodies, like the ability of Boston Brand, a.k.a. Deadman.\\n\\n\\n=== Reign in Hell ===\\nRalph and Sue, in their ghostly forms, appear before Doctor Occult with news of the war brewing in Hell. Sent by Giovanni \"John\" Zatara who, as a member of the Hell Resistance Movement, hopes to take advantage of the war, they ask Doctor Occult to aid him in his plan. They then dissipate and leave him to make his decision.\\n\\n\\n=== Blackest Night ===\\n\\nIn Blackest Night #0, Ralph and Sue Dibny\\'s graves are shown during Black Hand\\'s chant. At the end of the issue (in the promotional profile image of the Black Lantern Corps) his hand is easily identifiable as popping out of its grave. Ralph and Sue\\'s corpses are revealed as having been reanimated as Black Lanterns, attacking Hawkman and Hawkgirl; Ralph beating Hawkman with his mace before ripping out Hawkman\\'s heart. Next, they are seen in Gotham City with the Black Lanterns the Martian Manhunter, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, and Firestorm preparing to kill the Flash and Green Lantern. He and Sue are both turned to ashes when the Indigo Tribe destroys their rings. In the final battle, the Flash looks around to see if Ralph and Sue were among those resurrected by the White Entity, only to be told by Green Lantern they were not coming back.\\n\\n\\n=== The New 52 ===\\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC\\'s continuity. In this new timeline, Ralph Dibny is apparently a rogue member of the Secret Six, under the alias of Damon Wells a.k.a. Big Shot, reporting to the Riddler who in this incarnation of the team serves as \"Mockingbird.\" After having reunited with his wife, Dibny makes his return as the costumed Elongated Man in Secret Six #12.\\n\\n\\n== Powers and abilities ==\\nThe Elongated Man gained his abilities by drinking a refined version of a soft drink named Gingold that contains the extract of a (fictional) fruit called gingo. It was revealed in Invasion #3 that he is a metahuman, and the Gingoid elixir interacted with his latent genes. An ordinary human would not develop such powers through ingesting the extract. In fact, most people are extremely allergic to highly concentrated Gingold. The only other hero in the DCU who uses Gingold is Stretch, a member of Hero Hotline who has been using the compound since the 1940s.\\nAs his name suggests, the Elongated Man can stretch his limbs and body to super-human lengths and sizes. These stretching powers grant the Elongated Man heightened agility enabling flexibility and coordination that is beyond the natural limits of the human body. He can contort his body into various positions and sizes impossible for ordinary humans, such as being entirely flat so that he can slip under a door, or using his fingers to pick conventional locks. He can also use it for disguise by changing the shape of his face, although this is painful and difficult for him. Ralph\\'s physiology has greater physical limitations than Plastic Man; there is a limit to how far he can stretch his finite bodily mass, and he cannot open holes in his body as Plastic Man can.\\nThe Elongated Man\\'s powers also greatly augment his durability. He is largely able to withstand corrosives, punctures and concussions without sustaining injury. It has been demonstrated that he is resistant to high velocities that would kill an ordinary person and that he is also more resistant to blasts from energy weapons that would kill ordinary humans. His physiology is more like that of an ordinary human than Plastic Man and, as a result, he does not share Plastic Man\\'s nigh-invulnerability.\\nIn addition to his stretching abilities, the Elongated Man is professionally trained as a detective and is highly skilled in deductive reasoning. Often considered one of the most brilliant detectives in the DC Universe (compared with Batman only differing in the actual course of their logic). He is a talented amateur chemist as well. A meta-side effect of his powers coupled with his detective skills is enhanced olfactory sense, allowing him to \"smell\" when something is \"not right\", or if a clue or mystery is at hand. This results in a rubbery \"nose twitch\". Firehawk once told Ralph that the Green Arrow said the nose twitch was not a real thing but rather something he made up to get more press. The Elongated Man responded by telling her that the Green Arrow\\'s hat covers a bald spot.\\n\\n\\n== Other versions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Kingdom Come ===\\nIn Kingdom Come, when Superman comes out of retirement and re-establishes the Justice League, Batman recruits Ralph Dibny to become part of his faction. They infiltrate Lex Luthor\\'s Mankind Liberation Front and once they discover that Luthor is brainwashing Captain Marvel, they attack and incarcerate the MLF members.\\n\\n\\n=== The Dark Knight Strikes Again ===\\nIn Frank Miller\\'s The Dark Knight Strikes Again, Dibny is mentioned as a man in a bar who was reminiscing about the Silver Age and when he heard mention of Batman, his face sagged and his jaw dropped to the floor. Later Dibny is seen hawking a \"male enhancement\" drink \"Gingold\" in a TV infomercial. He is then recruited to aid Batman in his attack against the American government (taken over by Lex Luthor).\\n\\n\\n=== JLA/Avengers ===\\nThe Elongated Man appears in JLA/Avengers #3, replacing Plastic Man after the merging of the DC and Marvel Universes.\\n\\n\\n=== Justice League Unlimited ===\\nThe Elongated Man has appeared in the Justice League Unlimited spin-off comic book.\\n\\n\\n=== Countdown to Final Crisis ===\\nRecently the Ralph Dibny of Earth-51, where secret identities are no longer needed by superheroes, has been seen in Countdown to Final Crisis. He is subsequently killed by the Monitor of New Earth, Bob.\\n\\n\\n=== The Flash (2016) ===\\nAn evil future version of Elongated Man called Elongated Maniac appears in The Flash #53. He appears in Commander Cold\\'s flashbacks to an encounter where he faces off against Commander Cold after killing hostages.\\n\\n\\n== In other media ==\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\n\\n\\n==== Live-action ====\\n\\nRalph Dibny / Elongated Man appears in live-action media set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Hartley Sawyer.\\nDibny first appears in The Flash television series as a recurring character in season four before being promoted to series regular for seasons five and six. While he was originally stated to be deceased due to Eobard Thawne\\'s particle accelerator explosion in season one, Dibny\\'s death was undone following the Flashpoint timeline being undone in season three while he makes his first appearance in the season four episode, \"Elongated Journey Into Night\". This version was a police detective for the Central City Police Department until Barry Allen discovered that he had committed perjury by planting evidence. After Dibny was ousted from the police force, he became a private investigator specializing in infidelity cases. He acquires his elastic powers after the Thinker manipulates Team Flash into opening a breach, which exposed Dibny to dark matter. After discovering Dibny\\'s powers, Allen takes him to S.T.A.R. Labs to stabilize. Deciding to give Ralph a second chance after hearing he only planted the evidence because he was certain that the suspect was guilty but was unable to prove it, Allen adds him to the S.T.A.R. Labs team and helps him become a superhero. Over the course of the season, Dibny substitutes for Allen while the latter serves time in prison, but the media sees him as a joke and initially dubs him the \"Stretchy Man\" before calling him the Elongated Man due to a misunderstanding. Dibny also develops the ability to morph into other people, which he uses to free Barry from prison. In season five, Dibny launches an investigation into Caitlin Snow\\'s childhood and helps Team Flash combat the serial killer Cicada. In season six, Ralph is hired to find Sue Dearbon and receives a badge bearing his symbol from the comics during a press conference held to recognize him as one of Central City\\'s protectors. He eventually finds Dearbon, only to learn she is a thief. Due to this, he becomes inspired to reform her, which he eventually succeeds in. Prior to and during the beginning of season seven, Dibny and Dearbon went \"way off\" the grid in light of Eva McCulloch framing the latter for murder. They return to assist in the final confrontation with McCulloch, but Dibny appears wearing a mask to protect himself after he suffered serious burns raiding a Black Hole facility. Once Dearbon is exonerated following McCulloch\\'s defeat, she and Dibny leave to travel the world and stop criminal organizations.\\nDibny also appeared in the sixth annual Arrowverse crossover event \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\".\\n\\n\\n==== Animation ====\\n\\nElongated Man makes background appearances in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Jeremy Piven. This version is a member of the Justice League.\\nElongated Man appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Sean Donnellan. This version possesses shape-shifting abilities. In the teaser for the episode \"Journey to the Center of the Bat\", he works with Plastic Man and Batman to stop Baby Face. In the two-part episode \"The Siege of Starro!\", the Elongated Man falls under the titular alien\\'s control before he is eventually freed.\\nElongated Man appears in Mad, voiced by Ralph Garman.\\nElongated Man appears in the Young Justice: Outsiders episode \"Terminus\", voiced by David Kaye. This version is a member of the Justice League, whom he assists in attacking Granny Goodness\\' stronghold before she subjects the heroes to the Anti-Life Equation.\\n\\n\\n=== Film ===\\nAn evil, alternate reality version of Elongated Man called Extruded Man appears in the animated film Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths. This character is a member of the Crime Syndicate of America and was formerly a member of his universe\\'s Martian Manhunter henchmen before serving Owlman. The Extruded Man and several Crime Syndicate members face the Justice League, but the former is defeated by the Flash.\\nA Flashpoint version of Elongated man called Elongated Kid is mentioned in the animated film Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox as having been murdered.\\nElongated Man makes a brief appearance in the animated film Teen Titans Go!

The Agnus Dei is \"the liturgical chant which from ancient times has been sung at Mass at the time of the fractio panis, or the Breaking of the Bread, which precedes the Communion Rite of both the priest and the people\".The Catholic Church recommends that the bread for use in the celebration \"be made in such a way that the priest at Mass with a congregation is able in practice to break it into parts for distribution to at least some of the faithful\". It does not rule out the use of small hosts, \"when the number of those receiving Holy Communion or other pastoral needs require it\".It goes on to say: \"The action of the fraction or breaking of bread, which gave its name to the Eucharist in apostolic times, will bring out more clearly the force and importance of the sign of unity of all in the one bread, and of the sign of charity by the fact that the one bread is distributed among the brothers and sisters.\"The actual rite is described as follows by the General Instruction of the Roman Missal:\\n\\nThe priest breaks the Eucharistic Bread, assisted, if the case calls for it, by the deacon or a concelebrant. Christ\\'s gesture of breaking bread at the Last Supper, which gave the entire Eucharistic Action its name in apostolic times, signifies that the many faithful are made one body (1 Cor 10:17) by receiving Communion from the one Bread of Life which is Christ, who died and rose for the salvation of the world. The fraction or breaking of bread is begun after the sign of peace and is carried out with proper reverence, though it should not be unnecessarily prolonged, nor should it be accorded undue importance. This rite is reserved to the priest and the deacon. The priest breaks the Bread and puts a piece of the host into the chalice to signify the unity of the Body and Blood of the Lord in the work of salvation, namely, of the living and glorious Body of Jesus Christ.\\nIn speaking of the bread to be used at Mass, the General Instruction, 321 recommends that\\n\\nthe eucharistic bread ... be made in such a way that the priest at Mass with a congregation is able in practice to break it into parts for distribution to at least some of the faithful. Small hosts are, however, in no way ruled out when the number of those receiving Holy Communion or other pastoral needs require it. The action of the fraction or breaking of bread, which gave its name to the Eucharist in apostolic times, will bring out more clearly the force and importance of the sign of unity of all in the one bread, and of the sign of charity by the fact that the one bread is distributed among the brothers and sisters.\\nAt the 2005 assembly of the Synod of Bishops some participants deplored the practice whereby \"the Fractio Panis is gradually assuming an inferior role to the peace\". In the apostolic exhortation issued by Pope Benedict XVI following that assembly, he said of the sign of peace: \"During the Synod of Bishops there was discussion about the appropriateness of greater restraint in this gesture, which can be exaggerated and cause a certain distraction in the assembly just before the reception of Communion. It should be kept in mind that nothing is lost when the sign of peace is marked by a sobriety which preserves the proper spirit of the celebration.\" On 8 June 2014, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments sent to the presidents of episcopal conferences a letter requesting correction of excesses that had crept in regarding the sign of peace.\\n\\n\\n=== Western Orthodox ===\\nIn the restored Gallican Mass of the Western Orthodox Church, in which leavened bread is used exclusively, the fraction occurs immediately after the anaphora and prior to the Our Father with its introduction.  This is slightly earlier than in other western rites, in which the fraction typically takes place at some point after the Our Father.\\nThe method of the fraction varies from a simple breaking into pieces by hand to a more elaborate cutting with a liturgical knife known as a spear, as is commonly done in the Byzantine rite.  The action is accompanied by the singing of a responsory drawn both from the Emmaus account in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 24:13-35) and a selection from the opening verses of chapter 9 of the Book of Proverbs.\\n\\nFrom Septuagesima until the end of Holy Week, the alleluia is omitted, and the responsory is sung more simply to Gregorian psalm tone 2.\\n\\n\\n=== Anglican ===\\nIn the churches of the Anglican Communion, the rite is similar to that practised in the Roman Catholic Church, and consists of the priest breaking the Host in half and making an exclamation, such as, \"We break this bread to share in the body of Christ\", and the faithful making a response, such as, \"Though we are many we are one body, because we all share in one bread\" The response may change during certain liturgical seasons, or according to the rite being celebrated.  A Fraction Anthem may be sung or spoken during the rite.\\n\\n\\n== Eastern Christian ==\\n\\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine rite, leavened bread is used for the Eucharist. The round loaves, or prosphora, are stamped so that a Greek cross is in the center, with the letters \"IC XC NI-KA\" (Greek for \"Jesus Christ conquers\") occupying the quarters formed by the cross\\' arms. The square portion occupied by this stamp, the \"Lamb\", is cut out before the Divine Liturgy during the preparatory rite and is the only part consecrated during the Epiclesis. As part of the Liturgy of Preparation, the priest cuts the Lamb part way through crosswise into four sections from the bottom, leaving the bread united by the stamped crust on top.\\nAt the Fraction, which follows the Lord\\'s Prayer and the Elevation, the celebrant breaks the Lamb into four portions along the cuts already made, as he says the words: \"Broken and divided is the Lamb of God, which is broken and not disunited, which is ever eaten and never consumed, but sanctifieth those that partake thereof.\" He then arranges the four pieces crosswise on the edge of the diskos (paten). On the invitation of the deacon, \"Fill, Master, the holy chalice,\" the celebrant takes the piece with the letters \"IC\" and places it into the chalice saying, \"The fulness of the cup, of the faith, of the Holy Spirit.\"\\nThe portion with the letters \"XC\" is used for the communion of the clergy. The two portions \"NI\" and \"KA\" are divided into small pieces and placed in the chalice for the communion of the people. The portion \"IC\" is not used for communion, but is consumed by the deacon along with any other consecrated elements left over at the end of the Liturgy (see Ablution in Christianity).\\n\\n\\n== Protestant Reformation ==\\nReformed Christians symbolize their belief that Christ is not physically hidden in the bread by breaking the bread. This was a controversial practice among Protestants during the Reformation, as it shocked the sensibilities of Lutherans, who believe Christ\\'s body to be physically present in the Eucharist. Lutherans mocked Calvinists by calling them Stuttenfressers (roll eaters).\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nBarry M.

He is a caveman who has been a member of various versions of the Teen Titans in the comic books in the early 1970s.\\n\\n\\n== Fictional character biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-Crisis ===\\nPrior to the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Gnarrk was a time displaced Neanderthal stranded in the present. Through love and telepathic communication, Lilith teaches him human language and customs. Later, both retire from the Teen Titans to live together, apparently as a couple. Later, Gnarrk and Lilith briefly joined Teen Titans West before it disbanded. Several years later at Donna Troy\\'s wedding, Lilith mentioned Gnarrk\\'s \"terrible fate\", but didn\\'t elaborate on it. The readers never found out what Gnarrk\\'s final fate was, Pre-Crisis.\\n\\n\\n=== Post-Crisis ===\\nGnarrk\\'s story began thousands of years ago. Gnarrk was a nineteen-year-old Cro-Magnon who was fascinated by the lights in the skies. One night, a comet crashed before him, embedding a chunk of crystal into his chest. Somehow, this caused a transformation in him — it expanded his mind and his understanding.Soon, a volcanic disturbance threatened Gnarrk. The jewel in his chest protected him by encasing him in ice. Centuries passed, and Gnarrk remained in his ice tomb. During that time, his mind still worked, and Gnarrk dreamed of a better world. He used his abilities to cure disease and control the forces of nature to benefit mankind.\\nBased on psychic flashes from Lilith, the Teen Titans traveled to Southeast Asia, where they eventually found Gnarrk still encased in ice. He sensed Lilith\\'s presence and called out to her. Lilith used her powers to establish a mental rapport with Gnarrk. He told her his name, and she found out his true origins and his noble intentions. Although Lilith was dating Don Hall (Dove) at the time, she nonetheless found herself attracted to the gentle soul.\\nThe Titans brought Gnarrk back to S.T.A.R. Labs. It was established that he was dying. The S.T.A.R. scientists wanted to dissect him, but the Titans prevented them from doing so.\\nGnarrk remained on life support for almost a year with Lilith by his side. Gnarrk\\'s light in his chest eventually faded, and he died. When S.T.A.R. scientists performed an autopsy, they found the stone no longer had any special abilities. Whatever abilities the stone possessed vanished upon Gnarrk\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n=== The New 52 ===\\nGnarrk is a member of the original incarnation of the Teen Titans. Nothing is known about his past or origins, though Gnarrk is shown fully integrated into society when he meets Roy Harper, when the two meet. Along with Hank Hall and Dawn Granger, Roy and Gnarrk are met by Lilith. Lilith explains how they were the original Teen Titans and how she was forced to erase their memories of their group and each other, to protect them after their souls became entangled with an occult ritual conducted by Mr. Twister.During the Heroes in Crisis storyline, Gnarrk has checked into Sanctuary. He among the heroes who are killed in an unexpected attack.\\n\\n\\n== Powers and abilities ==\\nBeing a Cro-Magnon, Gnarrk possesses greater strength, dexterity, and endurance. When a comet embedded a chunk of crystal into his chest, it caused a transformation in Gnarrk where it expanded his mind, and his understanding. The full range of his expanded mental abilities were uncatalogued.\\n\\n\\n== In other media ==\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\nGnarrk appeared in the Teen Titans episode \"Kole\", voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. He lives in the Arctic Circle with his best friend, Kole, in a vast series of caverns that are inhabited by prehistoric creatures. All Gnarrk could say was \"gnarrk\", yet Kole could understand him and communicate with him quite well; he also seems to have a crush on her. Stemming from bad experiences with the modern world, Gnarrk suffers from a major technophobia. He and Kole first appear where they save the Teen Titans from a pack of Velociraptors. Gnarrk helped the Titans stop Dr. Light when he attempted to kidnap Kole. Cyborg was never able to pronounce his name right (but did in \"Calling all Titans\"), and always had to be corrected by Kole or his teammates. Gnarrk and Kole are nearly overpowered by Gizmo and Billy Numerous in \"Calling All Titans\", but some quick thinking by Kole ends with them prevailing. Later they are part of a group of reinforcements that come to rescue Beast Boy, Pantha, Más, Herald, and Jericho from the Brotherhood of Evil in \"Titans Together\". The first villain they take out is the Ding Dong Daddy. They end up helping to defeat the villains and save the day.\\n\\n\\n=== Miscellaneous ===\\nIn his first appearance in Teen Titans Go!, Gnarrk was apparently kidnapped from his home. Along with several other kidnapped Titans, Gnarrk was forced to fight Private H.I.V.E. for the entertainment of spectators and villains. They were all saved by Kole and several other Titans who came to rescue them.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n'], ['Go!_You_Packers_Go!', 'Sports_teams', '\"Go!

The director of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), Riccardo Giacconi, decided to allocate some of his \"Director\\'s Discretionary\" time to amateur observing programs. In December 1985, the leaders of seven national amateur astronomy organizations met at STScI in Baltimore to discuss the participation of amateur astronomers in the HST project.The team used the Hubble Space Telescope to perform a spectroscopic search for OH emission from five asteroids. OH emission would indicate that the asteroids were once comets. 944 Hidalgo and 2201 Oljato move in elliptical, comet-like orbits. 182 Elsa, 224 Oceana, and 899 Jokaste are main-belt asteroids. The last three have been observed with coma (Kresak, 1977). Concurrently with the spectroscopic study, ground-based visual observations were carried out by 80 amateur astronomers in 22 countries.\\n\\n\\n== The amateur observing team ==\\nThe team had over 70 primary observers. Observers were located in 24 states of the U.S., and 22 different countries.\\n\\n\\n== Research and study ==\\nScientists suspect that some asteroids were once comets. A comet loses part of its mass with each passage around the Sun. It would appear that some would eventually use all of their volatiles, or perhaps cover these under a blanket of dust after repeated passages around the Sun. Such an object might then have an asteroid appearance.The asteroid 944 Hidalgo is most frequently discussed as being in a comet-like orbit. In fact, Kresak (1977) identified it as an \"extinct comet nucleus\". In addition, comets tend to approach Jupiter closely while asteroids do not. Hidalgo approaches Jupiter at nearly the same distance as 3 comets: Comet Encke, Comet Arend-Rigaux, and Comet Neujmin I, all of which exhibit the low levels of activity expected of comets before they become extinct.The Pioneer Venus Orbiter detected magnetic field disturbances that are correlated with 2201 Oljato. This could be caused by an outgassing of H at a rate of about 10−4 that for an active comet. Oljato\\'s possible comet-like nature is supported by its unusual UV reflectance. It has been interpreted as Rayleigh scattering from a cloud of fine particles around it.On December 13, 1923, the astronomer Josep Comas Solá observed the asteroid 224 Oceana with a coma. The asteroid was photographed with a faint halo 30 arc-seconds across. The asteroid\\'s magnitude was determined to be 11.6, and at the asteroid\\'s heliocentric distance of 167 million miles, this made the coma about 24,000 miles across.\\nThe existence of volatiles on asteroids would be of great significance to future miners of the asteroid belt. Volatiles could supply water, fuel and oxygen for missions.For the 1993 study involving amateur astronomers and the Hubble Space Telescope, 944 Hidalgo and 2201 Oljato were examined with the Hubble Space telescope\\'s Faint Object Spectrograph for 3085 A emission of OH. These two asteroids were selected because of the nature of their orbits, their meteor-shower associations, and their other characteristics (see Weissman et al. (1989) for a full discussion of their comet-like features). The amber detector was used in the accumulation mode with spectral element G270H. This element covers wavelengths 2325-3225 A. The aperture was 1 arc-second.\\nThe asteroids 182 Elsa, 224 Oceana, and 899 Jokaste were also observed with the Faint Object Spectrograph, and with the same spectral element G270H.The team leaders placed advertisements in amateur astronomy publications for amateur observers who would be willing to observe these objects in the visible spectrum from the ground, while the HST was making studies in the UV. The ground-based observers were asked to check for evidence of a dust coma.\\n\\n\\n== Results ==\\nThe spectra for 944 Hidalgo, and 2201 Oljato are essentially identical to the solar spectrum. No OH emission, or other emission lines were apparent.\\nGround-based observations of these two objects were limited to several CCD images of the area in which 2201 Oljato was calculated to appear. Both 944 Hidalgo, and 2201 Oljato were near 19th magnitude. This placed them beyond the limit of most amateur telescopes.\\nNone of the other three asteroids showed signs of the cometary emission that would be expected from a weakly active cometary nucleus. This should not be surprising, since the targets lie in stable main-belt orbits.\\nGround-based observations of 182 Elsa, 224 Oceana, and 899 Jokaste were conducted visually, photographically, with VHS, and with CCD equipment. 224 Oceana was at 12th magnitude during the HST observations. 182 Elsa was also at 12th magnitude, and 899 Jokaste appeared at 15th magnitude.\\nAll visual observations showed point images, with no sign of a dust coma. Photographic images gave the same result. A number of observers were able to accumulate CCD images in order to reach fainter magnitudes. Using this method, two observers reported signs of a possible short tail on the asteroid 899 Jokaste. This appeared around 17th magnitude. Studies of nearby stars on the original image suggest that this was due to a small amount of trailing during guiding. There was no further evidence of a coma around any of the three asteroids.\\nObservations of 944 Hidalgo and 2201 Oljato had to be conducted before the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. As a result, the two asteroids were not in convenient positions to detect OH. Hidalgo was imaged at 5 Astronomical Units from the Sun, and moving away. This is approximately the same distance as SL-9 was before it impacted on Jupiter. The Hubble Space Telescope, using the same Faint Object Spectrograph and spectral element G270H, also failed to find any evidence of OH from SL-9.\\n2201 Oljato was near aphelion when it was observed. From the distance of the asteroid belt, any OH signature may have been hidden by noise in the data of the 19th magnitude asteroid. Ideally, both objects should have been studied shortly after perihelion passage.\\nThe main-belt asteroids 224 Oceana, 182 Elsa, and 899 Jokaste were observed near opposition, but did not show any evidence of OH emission. The last two were observed when the Hubble Space Telescope was having guidance problems, and had to present special orientation to the Sun due to the loss of one solar panel. The reports of previous coma may have been due to impacts.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nProposal: Schenk, Harald (February 23, 1994). \"Transition Comets: UV Search for OH\".

During debates with Sherrod Brown, a debate at WOSU-TV studios in Columbus was almost cancelled after \"last-minute arguing between the two sides, fueled by Renacci\\'s recent escalation of personal attacks against Brown.\"In March 2018, the Associated Press reported that as a registered lobbyist, Renacci had failed to report $50,000 in political contributions he had been given from 2008 to 2010. Renacci\\'s campaign, in response, said he never lobbied, and had only been registered as a lobbyist with a consulting firm, Smokerise International Group, he helped found in 2008 as a \"precautionary measure.\" Although Renacci\\'s lawyer provided paperwork to journalists showing he had been listed as \"inactive\" as a lobbyist in 2009, the Associated Press found Renacci\\'s lobbyist registration was deactivated in May 2011, the year when the paperwork was filed, and four months after he entered Congress.In October 2018, he defended flying on the plane of a strip club owner to meet with religious figures, staying \"He\\'s a volunteer who... I met during the campaign. He asked to volunteer for me. I\\'m not going to vet volunteers, and I\\'m not going to vet the press\\'s looking at volunteers.\" At the time, press and Ohio Republicans noted that since the May primary, Renacci had spent half a million on advertising, while Brown had spent $12.5 million, and \"some Ohio Republicans have questioned whether Renacci\\'s lack of advertising reflects his unwillingness to spend his own money on his race. Renacci has loaned his campaign $4 million of his own money, which represent[ed] the majority of his campaign fundraising.\"Renacci was defeated by incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown in the November 6, 2018, general election. Brown received 53% of the vote, while Renacci received 47%.\\n\\n\\n== Post congressional career ==\\nAs of 2019, Renacci is the Chairman of Ohio\\'s Future Foundation, which he founded after losing the 2018 U.S. Senate election to Brown.On June 25, 2020, Renacci announced that he had been drafted to serve as the Chairman of the Medina County GOP.\\n\\n\\n== 2022 Ohio gubernatorial campaign ==\\n\\nRenacci wrote a number of op-eds criticizing Ohio governor Mike DeWine.  May 2021, NBC News reported that Brad Parscale was offering unpaid support to Renacci in considering a gubernatorial bid.  a tweet criticizing Governor Mike DeWine in June 2021, WKYC hinted Renacci might enter the race for governor in 2022. He launched a primary campaign officially later on June 9, 2021. He stated in an interview, \"Ohio cannot afford for Mike DeWine to be the governor anymore. My path may have been diverted in 2018 but my will really to change Ohio was not.\" He said he wouldn\\'t have hired Amy Acton, Ohio Department of Health director, saying her announcement of early predictions about COVID-19 had been a \"scare tactic. That scared people.\" With his gubernatorial bid advised by Brad Parscale, Renacci also stated \"Trump is still a friend. I think in the end if I get an opportunity to talk with him, which I\\'m hoping to be able to do that, he\\'ll see that Jim Renacci has a really good opportunity.\" Although he had stated his support for Trump, by June 22, 2021, Trump hadn\\'t endorsed a candidate in the Ohio Senate or gubernatorial races. Alongside Parscale, Renacci brought in \"numerous\" other former Trump staffers to his campaign, according to The Gazette.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 2012, The Christian Science Monitor included Renacci in its list of the 10 richest members of Congress, estimating his net worth at $36.67 million.In 2017, Renacci\\'s net worth was estimated at $83.32 million.In June 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the state of Ohio must refund $359,822 that Renacci and his wife had paid in penalties in a dispute over their 2000 taxes. The court\\'s opinion stated that the Ohio tax commissioner had abused his discretion by penalizing the Renaccis because the couple had reasonably believed they did not owe taxes on profits from an entity that the state later determined was subject to taxation. The Renaccis had relied on an earlier legal interpretation in delaying tax payments.\\n\\n\\n== Electoral history ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nJim Renacci at Curlie\\nAppearances on C-SPANBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\\nProfile at Vote Smart\\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\\n'], ['Joe_Petagno', 'Artists', 'Joe Petagno (born January 1, 1948) is an American artist known principally for creating images used on rock album covers for bands such as Led Zeppelin, Nazareth, Black Oak Arkansas, Sweet, Hawkwind, Motörhead, Roy Harper, Marduk, Bal-Sagoth, Autopsy, Attick Demons, Illdisposed and Sodom.\\nPetagno was born in Portland, Maine and left the United States in 1972.

In 1986, he was a recipient of the Silver Olympic Order.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nAkii-Bua was raised in a family of 43 children from one father and his eight wives. Akii-Bua started his athletic career as a short-distance hurdler, but failed to qualify for the 1968 Olympics. Coached by British-born athletics coach Malcolm Arnold, he was introduced to the 400 meter hurdles. After finishing fourth in the 1970 Commonwealth Games and running the fastest time of 1971, he was not a big favourite for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, having limited competitive experience. Nevertheless, he won the final there, setting a world record time of 47.82 seconds despite running on the inside lane. He missed the 1976 Olympics and a showdown with United States rival Edwin Moses because of the boycott by Uganda and other African nations.As a police officer, Akii-Bua was promoted by Ugandan president Idi Amin and given a house as a reward for his athletic prowess. When the Amin regime was collapsing, he fled to Kenya with his family, fearful that he would be seen as a collaborator; this was more likely because he was a member of the Langi tribe, many of whom were persecuted by Amin, whereas Akii-Bua was cited by Amin as an example of a Langi who was doing well. However, in Kenya he was put into a refugee camp. From there, he was freed by his shoe-manufacturer Puma and lived in Germany working for Puma for 3–4 years. He represented Uganda once again at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Later he returned to Uganda and became a coach.Akii-Bua died a widower, at the age of 47, survived by eleven children. He was given a state funeral. His nephew is international footballer David Obua, and his brother Lawrence Ogwang competed in the long jump and triple jump at the 1956 Olympics.The phrase \"akii-buas\" has come to colloquially mean \"runs\" in Uganda.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nProfile\\n'], ['Josiah_Kibira_University_College', 'Universities_and_colleges', 'Josiah Kibira University College (JoKUCo) is a constituent college of Tumaini University Makumira in Bukoba, Tanzania.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\n'], ['Julius_Nyerere_University_of_Agriculture', 'Universities_and_colleges', \"The Julius Nyerere University of Agriculture (JNUA) is a proposed public university that will be built in northern Tanzania.

A student of art history, Van der Bruggen had hopes of building a castle from an early age. Inspired by an old abandoned farm on the river Tarn in the South of France, Van der Bruggen converted the farm into his dream castle, complete with carriage entrance, fountains, and towers.

It has several key services, the AAFES Post Exchange, Car Care Center and gas station. It also has family and guest housing.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nConstruction began in 1935 as a Luftwaffe airfield named Fliegerhorst Ansbach and was completed in 1938.  The airfield was primarily a bomber airfield, with the first unit, Kampfgeschwader 155 (KG 155) being assigned to the new base in April 1936, equipped with an early model of the Heinkel He 111, the He 111B.  Other prewar bomber units assigned were KG 355 (July 1938, Dornier Do 17Z); KG 53 (May 1939, He 111).   These bomber units were used in the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.\\n\\n\\n=== German use during World War II ===\\nDuring World War II, Ansbach was initially used to form and equip bomber units until mid 1943.  KG 2, KG 77, KG 6 and KG 76 all were assigned to the base with a variety of bombers (Do 17, Ju 88s) which flew missions from Ansbach to France, England, and Russia.It was only in the late summer of 1943, with the increasing number of Allied bomber attacks on Germany, that Ansbach was assigned to the \"Defense of the Reich\", campaign, and day interceptor fighters were assigned to the airfield to attack the American Eighth Air Force heavy bomber formations. Numerous Luftwaffe fighter units were assigned to Ansbach during 1943-late 1944, when as a result of Allied attacks, the airfield became unusable.  Known units assigned were ZG 76 (1943–1944, Bf 110), JG 3 (1944, Bf 109G), JG 4, JG 300 (Fw 190A).   The last operational unit assigned,  KG 101, equipped with Ju 88As, moved out in August 1944, after which Ansbach was the home of various Luftwaffe ground units (Flughafen-Bereichs-Kommando), the last of which moved out in April 1945 (FBK 14/VII), blowing up the runway, aircraft hangars and other technical buildings.\\n\\n\\n=== USAAF use ===\\nAnsbach airfield was attacked by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers beginning in early 1945 as Allied ground units began fanning out into Bavaria to deny the Luftwaffe use of the airfield.  The airfield was seized by the United States Third Army, in late April, and the IX Engineering Command 831st Engineering Aviation Brigade moved in on 23 April 1945 to repair operational facilities and clear unexploded mines and other dangerous munitions from the field.  Engineers also patched the 4000\\' concrete runway and the facility was declared operational on 29 April, being designated as Advanced Landing Ground \"R-45 Ansbach\".The Ninth Air Force 354th Fighter Group flew P-47 Thunderbolts beginning the next day and continued combat operations until the German capitulation on 7 May 1945.   The Air Force combat units moved out in May 1945, and the facility was turned over to Air Technical Service Command, becoming a maintenance and supply facility under the 42d Air Depot (Ansbach Air Depot).  United States Army units moved in when the Air Force depot was closed at the end of May 1947 and used the airfield as a garrison post as part of the American Zone of Occupation, renaming the facility Katterbach Kaserne.\\n\\n\\n=== United States Army use ===\\nAfter the end of the United States occupation of Germany in 1949,  Katterbach Kaserne became a NATO facility, becoming the home of EES (European Exchange System) until the 60\\'s when the first Army Aviation unit arrived, A Company 504th Aviation Battalion, 4th Armored Division APO NY 09177.  The Facility became the home of the US Army 1st Armored Division in 1971. Numerous 1st AD units have used Katterbach over the past 60 years, the facility becoming a combat helicopter airfield in 1977, and remaining so, although after 1993, the number of personnel and helicopters has been reduced as a result of the USAREUR restructuring after the end of the Cold War. Across the street is Bismarck Kaserne that was occupied by 1-37 Armor from 1970 - 1988. After 1-37 Armor redeployed to Vilseck in 1988, 1-1 Cavalry occupied Bismarck Kaserne until their deactivation. The Kaserne was occupied by elements of 1st Infantry Division Aviation units until 2006 when aviation was restructured, and the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade was activated.  The Kaserne is currently home to 5-158 Aviation Regiment (GSAB), 3-158 Aviation Regiment (AASLT), and 412th Aviation Support Battalion (ASB).\\nAlthough used as a helicopter airfield for the past 40 years, Katterbach Kaserne has little resemblance to the Luftwaffe wartime airfield  from which it originated.   The airfield retains its circular support area, with numerous hangars and warehouses from its air depot use by the Air Force,  however a large concrete ramp was constructed by the Army over the original grass airfield for helicopter parking.    The wartime 4000\\' concrete runway has been removed, with a short 1,212\\' asphalt runway replacing it, aligned 08/26 for helicopter use.

His whereabouts have been unknown since 2004.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nHe was born in exile (due to the Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush), in Chuy Region, Kirghizia, into the Yalkhoi teip (clan) from the Geldagan village in Shalinsky District of Chechnya. He arrived in Moscow in 1974 and matriculated into Moscow State University, Faculty of Law. Along with Said-Khasan Abumuslimov (later Vice-President of Chechnya under Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev) he organized an underground committee for the liberation of Chechnya called Obshina. The committee studied books by Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Andrei Sakharov. According to Noukhaev, Abumuslimov was responsible for politics and information while he took care of financial matters and weapons. In 1980 Nukhaev was sentenced to eight years for banditry, which he claimed were actually for political reasons. During this time he acquired the nickname “Khozha” and was considered a boss of the Chechen mafia along with Nikolay Suleimanov. By 1987 Chechen criminals had developed into a well-organized community under Nukhayev and Suleimanov, the group tried to force the most influential Russian Mafia gangs (the Lyubertsy, Solntsevo, and Balashikha) out of Moscow which allowed the Chechens to occupy the dominant position for some time.\\n\\n\\n== Activities during the Second Chechen War ==\\nSoon after the start of the Second Chechen War, Nukhaev left for Baku, Azerbaijan, and financed the underground Chechen newspapers Ichkeria and Mekh-kell. In 1999 he made a public statement calling for an international commission to bring peace to Chechnya, saying Russia will never gain its objectives by military means because the Chechen people\\'s will for self-determination is such that guerrilla warfare will continue for years. Noukhaev said the first step in the peace process should be establishment of an International Commission headed by such respected world figures as former President Jimmy Carter or former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to oversee the freeing of illegally detained persons on both sides. It is believed by some that he also helped finance the militant groups of Ruslan Gelayev and Aslambek Abdulkhadzhiev. In 2001 Nukhaev first proposed the controversial idea (among both his allies and enemies) of splitting Chechnya into a northern Russian half and a southern de facto, but not de jure Ichkerian half.  That same year Nukhaev founded the inter-teip movement Nokhchi-Latta-Islam, and politician Aleksandr Dugin was also working with him during this time.\\n\\n\\n== Book by Paul Klebnikov ==\\nNoukhaev was the subject of a book entitled Conversation with a Barbarian: Interviews with a Chechen Field Commander on Banditry and Islam by the late American/Russian journalist Paul Klebnikov. The book is based on interviews with Noukhaev conducted by Klebnikov in Baku, Azerbaijan. In it, Noukhaev discusses his past, including his involvement in criminal activities in Moscow and creating Caucasian Common Market. He also argues for the superiority of the Chechen and Islamic clan/tribal-based social system, while Klebnikov argues for an opposite position. After Klebnikov\\'s murder in Moscow in 2004, it was alleged that Noukhaev had ordered the killing  in retaliation for his negative portrayal in this book. Several Chechens were charged with carrying out the killing on Noukhayev\\'s orders but all were subsequently acquitted at trial.\\n\\n\\n== Political activities in Russia ==\\nAfter April 2001, he became actively involved in work of Eurasia Party led by Russian nationalist Aleksandr Dugin, despite being officially wanted by police. On June 28, 2001, he appeared on the Dugin party\\'s press conference in Moscow to propose that Chechnya be divided into North Chechnya (the plains region within the frame of the Russian Federation) and South Chechnya (the mountain region largely independent from Russia, but still closely bonded to Russia and fiercely hostile to \"Wahhabism\", that is Islamic fundamentalism).\\n\\n\\n== Possible death in the mountains of Dagestan ==\\nKhozh-Akhmed Noukhaev stayed in Azerbaijan for an extended period of time following the outbreak of the Second Chechen War. It is from there that he posted updates to the internet site named after him, Noukhaev.com. According to some sources, Noukhaev secretly returned to Chechnya in late 2003. He supposedly convinced Ruslan Gelayev to cross Dagestan into Georgia and was with a group of Gelayev\\'s fighters when they were surrounded in the mountains during the winter of 2003-2004. According to an unofficial version of events, Gelayev\\'s men were taken captive or killed, and on December 28, 2003, Gelayev himself was killed as a result of gunfire and a  landslide or avalanche reportedly caused by rockets that were fired from a helicopter. Several sources speculate that Noukhaev was killed alongside the fighters, although a different version of events maintains that he was neither captured nor killed. In support of the first version is the circumstantial evidence that both Ichkeria and Mekh-Kell are no longer being published. Furthermore, there have been no new book-brochures by Noukhaev about Russian-Chechen and international relations, or promoting of his opinions on the future of Chechnya. These book-brochures were brought from Azerbaijan and can sometimes still be found in the markets of Grozny and Nazran.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nChechen mafia\\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\\nRussian mafia\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nInterview with Noukhaev — Scene taken from “The Making of a New Empire” by Jos de Putter\\nMaterials about Nukhaev (Russian), from database anticompromat.ru by Pribylovsky\\n'], ['Lance_Gibbs', 'Sportspeople', 'Lancelot Richard Gibbs (born 29 September 1934) is a former West Indies cricketer, one of the most successful spin bowlers in Test cricket history. He took 309 Test wickets, only the second player (after Fred Trueman) to pass 300, the first spinner to pass that milestone, and had an exceptional economy rate of under two runs per over.\\nIn 2009, Gibbs was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\nGibbs made his first-class debut in 1953–54, playing for British Guiana against MCC at his home ground of Bourda. In MCC\\'s first (and indeed only) innings, he bowled Denis Compton for 18 to leave the tourists precariously poised at 51/3. Gibbs also took the wicket of Tom Graveney – but by then a mammoth fourth-wicket partnership of 402 between Graveney and Willie Watson had propelled MCC towards an innings victory, so Gibbs did not get a second chance to bowl.\\nGibbs played a few more first-class games for British Guiana over the next few years, and some good performances (including 4/68 in the final of the Quadrangular Tournament against Barbados in 1956–57) gained him selection for the West Indies side to host Pakistan the following season. He made his debut in the second Test at Port-of-Spain, taking four wickets in the match, and retained his place for the rest of the five-match series, his first five-wicket haul in first-class cricket coming when he claimed 5/80 in the fourth Test at Bourda.\\nHe went on the tour to India in 1957–58, but played in only one Test, in which he went wicketless. The tour of Pakistan that immediately followed was a little more fruitful, with eight wickets in three games. However, it was the 1960–61 tour of Australia that was to prove a turning point in Gibbs\\' international career: he played only in the last three Tests, but took 19 wickets at 20.78: eight at Sydney, five at Adelaide (including a hat-trick) and six at Melbourne.\\nThe early 1960s were Gibbs\\' most productive period in Test cricket, and his greatest achievements came in the 1961–62 home series against India. Over the course of five Tests he picked up 24 wickets at just 20.41 apiece, including one of the game\\'s greatest spells of bowling at Bridgetown, where he single-handedly reduced the Indians from 149/2 to 187 all out with eight wickets in 15.3 overs at a total cost of just six runs; Gibbs\\' final innings return of 8/38 was his best in a Test match.\\nIn 1963, West Indies toured England, and Gibbs had another highly successful series, taking 26 wickets at 21.30 including 5/59 and 6/98 in a ten-wicket triumph at Manchester. Further successful series followed: indeed, in eight successive series topped and tailed by the 1960–61 and 1968–69 tours to Australia, Gibbs never took fewer than 18 Test wickets and took five or more wickets in an innings on 12 occasions.\\nIn 1967, Gibbs played for Warwickshire in the English County Championship, for whom he would continue to appear each season until 1973, although his appearances in 1969 and 1973 were reduced because of his commitments with West Indies\\' tours of England. In 1970, after a winter spent with South Australia, he took a career-best 8/37 against Glamorgan, but by far his most successful season in England was 1971 in which Gibbs claimed 131 first-class wickets at only 18.89, with nine five-wicket hauls. This exceptional performance gained Gibbs a Wisden Cricketer of the Year award in the following year\\'s Almanack. He has been retrospectively ranked by the ICC as the top bowler in Test cricket for five consecutive years starting from 1964.In 1973, at the age of almost 39, Gibbs made his One Day International debut against England at Leeds as part of the Prudential Trophy tournament, taking the wicket of England captain Mike Denness. He played only two further ODIs: the first again being against England two days later at the Oval (11–4–12–1 and the wicket of John Jameson), and a single outing against Sri Lanka at Manchester in the 1975 World Cup, in which he bowled just four overs without success.\\nGibbs\\' last Test matches were played on the tour of Australia in 1975–76. Although he played in all six Tests, and took 5/102 in the first innings of the first Test at Brisbane, his 16 wickets came at an average of over 40, the worst of his five series against these opponents. He passed the milestone of 300 Test victims at Perth by dismissing Gary Gilmour. His last Test match, and indeed his last appearance in senior cricket of any description, was at Melbourne, his 309th and final Test wicket being that – again – of Gilmour.\\nHe was, however, a very poor batsman, who never made a half-century in first-class cricket.\\nAfter his retirement from the game, Gibbs emigrated to the United States, but returned to prominence briefly in 1991 when he managed West Indies\\' tour to England. Gibbs is involved with the Lawrence Rowe Foundation, which helps at-risk kids.Gibbs is the cousin of another West Indies cricketer, Clive Lloyd, with whom he appeared for West Indies on a number of occasions.\\n\\n\\n== Record ==\\nGibbs is the oldest player to reach 300 Test wickets, doing so at the age of 41 in 1975/76.\\n\\n\\n== International cricket five-wicket hauls ==\\n\\nGibbs\\' first five-wicket haul came a month after his debut, when he took 5 wickets for 80 runs against Pakistan in the fourth Test of the latter\\'s 1957–58 tour of the West Indies.  His best bowling figures are 8 for 38 which he took in the third innings of the third Test between the West Indies and India at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.  Described by Cecil Kippins as \"the greatest ever bowling spell in Test Cricket\", Gibbs took the eight wickets in a sixteen-over spell, conceding six runs.   Although Gibbs played ODI cricket, he made just three appearances, during which his best bowling figures were 1 for 12.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nLance Gibbs at ESPNcricinfo\\n'], ['Leif_Elggren', 'Artists', 'Leif Elggren (born 1950, Linköping, Sweden), is a Swedish artist who lives and works in Stockholm.  \\nActive since the late 1970s, Leif Elggren has become one of the most constantly surprising conceptual artists to work in the combined worlds of audio and visual.  A writer, visual artist, stage performer and composer, he has many albums to his credits, solo and with the Sons of God, on labels such as Ash International, Touch, Radium and his own Firework Edition.  His music, often conceived as the soundtrack to a visual installation or experimental stage performance, usually presents carefully selected sound sources over a long stretch of time and can range from quiet electronics to harsh noise.  His wide-ranging and prolific body of art often involves dreams and subtle absurdities, social hierarchies turned upside-down, hidden actions and events taking on the quality of icons.\\nTogether with artist Carl Michael von Hausswolff, he is a founder of the Kingdoms of Elgaland-Vargaland (KREV) where he enjoys the title of king.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nElggren spent five years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm, specializing in drawing, design and bookprinting. In the late ‘70s he began to associate with performance groups, meeting people like Hausswolff and Thomas Liljenberg. With the latter he formed Firework in 1978, a duo that put up exhibitions and performances. Around the same time he purchased a press and started to publish art books. In 1982 he founded Firework Edition, a small publishing company, together with Liljenberg.\\nIn 1988 he formed the duo Guds Söner (The Sons of God) with Kent Tankred, whom he had met four years earlier. The duo excels in creating long, puzzling stage performances that give equal roles to physical action (or inaction) and soundtrack (live or taped) with themes such as violence, love, the quotidian, food and royalty.\\nElggren released his first 7\" records in 1982 and 1984 on Hausswolff\\'s label Radium. A first solo LP, Flown Over by an Old King, came out in 1988. The inception of Firework Edition in 1996 allowed Elggren to release more of his music and the growing popularity of installation art in avant-garde music circles (thanks to its ties with experimental electronica) has given his work more international exposure since the late ‘90s. Other key solo works include Talking to a Dead Queen (1996) and Pluralis Majestatis (2000).\\nTogether with Hausswolff, Elggren curated the Nordic Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2001.\\nIn 2007 he appeared (with John Duncan) at the Netmage festival in Bologna organized by xing and executed \"Something Like Seeing in the Dark\".\\n\\n\\n== Selected discography ==\\nFlown Over by an Old King (Radium 226.05, 1988)\\nTalking to a Dead Queen (Fylkingen, 1996)\\nPluralis Majestatis (Firework Edition, 2000)\\n9.11 (Desperation Is the Mother of Laughter) (Firework Edition, 2000) with Thomas Liljenberg\\nUGN/MAT (2000) with Per Jonsson and Kent Tankred\\nTwo Thin Eating One Fat (Firework Edition, 2000) with Thomas Liljenberg\\nTriangles (Moikai, 2001) with Kevin Drumm\\nExtraction (2002)\\nDEG (Firework Edition, 2002) with Mats Gustafsson and Kevin Drumm\\nThe Cobblestone Is the Weapon of the Proletariat (Firework Edition, 2004)\\nGottesdienst (iDEAL, 2006)\\nDas Baank (Fragment Factory/Rekem Records, 2016)\\nMOTOR for an Unknown Vehicle (Opening of the Grave) (Fragment Factory, 2019)\\n\\n\\n=== Compilation appearances ===\\nEmre (Dark Matter) (2000)\\nsuRRism-Phonoethics sPE_0100: Peak the Source Vol.3 (2011), Surrism-Phonoethics\\n30/4 (2013), Fragment Factory\\n\\n\\n== Interviews ==\\ninterview from Bananafish #16\\ninterview from Dusted (2004)\\ninterview from Perfect Sound Forever (2005)\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nLeif Elggren\\nThe Sons of God\\nFirework Edition Records\\nThe Kingdoms of Elgaland-Vargaland\\nAllMusic entry\\nDiscography at discogs.com\\n\"At Venice Biennale, Artists Plant Flag for Their State (of Mind)\" New York Times (June 9, 2007)\\n'], ['Lin_Dan', 'Sportspeople', 'Lin Dan (born 14 October 1983) is a Chinese former professional badminton player. He is a two-time Olympic champion, five-time World champion, as well as a six-time All England champion.\\nWidely regarded as the greatest badminton player of all time, by the age of 28 Lin had completed the \"Super Grand Slam\", having won what some consider to be the nine major titles in the badminton world: Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cup, Thomas Cup, Sudirman Cup, Super Series Masters Finals, All England Open, Asian Games, and Asian Championships, becoming the first and only player to achieve this feat. He also became the first men\\'s singles player to retain the Olympic gold medal by winning in 2008 and successfully defending his title in 2012.In 2004, he was dubbed \"Super Dan\" by opponent Peter Gade after winning the All England Open final, and the nickname has since been widely used by his fans as well as the media to refer to him, in recognition of his achievements.\\n\\n\\n== Badminton career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Junior events ===\\nLin emerged as a winner in the 2000 Badminton Asia Junior Championships in both the team and the singles events. He was also a member of the winning Chinese team and a boys\\' singles semi-finalist in the 2000 World Junior Championships.\\n\\n\\n=== 2001–2003 ===\\n2001 marked the start of then 18 year-old Lin\\'s professional career. In his first final, at the Asian Badminton Championships, he was thrashed by compatriot Xia Xuanze.In 2002 Lin took his first title at the Korea Open. He was a member of China\\'s 2002 Thomas Cup squad which defeated Sweden (5–0), Denmark (3–2), and South Korea (4–1) to reach the semifinals. However, Lin didn\\'t play in the semifinal tie against Malaysia, which saw China\\'s team tumble to a 1–3 defeat. Lin participated in another four tournaments without coming close to victory. He was knocked out in the first round of the Singapore, and Indonesia Opens, second round of the Denmark Open, and third round of the China Open. In October Lin was defeated in the semifinals of the Asian Games team competition which ended China\\'s hope of a team gold medal.Lin started the 2003 season with a third round defeat in the All England Open. He reached a final later in the year at the Japan Open but was beaten by his compatriot Xia Xuanze once again. Lin then made his inaugural debut in the World Championships in Birmingham, England. He breezed past Per-Henrik Croona and Przemysław Wacha in the first two rounds, but was beaten by Xia again in his third round match. After the world meet, he was eliminated in the semifinals of the Singapore Open, third round of the Indonesia Open, and second round of the Malaysia Open. However, Lin ended the season strongly by capturing the Denmark, Hong Kong, and China Opens, and finishing runner-up at the German Open.\\n\\n\\n=== 2004 ===\\nLin had a good start to 2004, earning the BWF\\'s number one world ranking for the first time in February. He helped China win the qualifying round of Thomas Cup and then captured the Swiss Open. He won his first ever All England Open title by beating Peter Gade in the final. He reached the semifinal of the Japan Open before going off to Jakarta, Indonesia in May for the Thomas Cup campaign.In Thomas Cup, Lin helped China to an excellent start in which they thrashed United States and defending champion Indonesia 5–0 respectively to enter the quarterfinals. Lin then defeated Shoji Sato and Lee Hyun-il in quarterfinal and semifinal ties against Japan and South Korea respectively, each ending in 3–0 wins for China. In the final, he beat Peter Gade in straight games to give China the lead before the Chinese team eventually won three matches to one. China thus took the crown, ending a 14 years drought in the tournament.Lin suffered setbacks later in the 2004 season when he was ousted in the quarterfinals of the Malaysia Open, and was reported to have a leg injury in mid-July, prior to the Olympic Games. Lin \"crashed\" in his first Olympic Games when, as the first seed, he was ousted early by Singapore\\'s Ronald Susilo, who claimed Lin was \"too eager to win\". However, Lin bounced back with three titles at the Denmark, German, and China Opens, and ended the season as a semi-finalist at the Indonesia Open.\\n\\n\\n=== 2005 ===\\nLin retained his number one world ranking during 2005, winning his second German and Hong Kong Open titles, as well as the Japan Open, China Masters, and World Cup tournaments. He also helped China recapture the Sudirman Cup (combined men\\'s and women\\'s team championship) when it shut-out both defending champion South Korea in the semifinals and Indonesia in the final.Lin failed to retain his All England title, losing a three set final to teammate Chen Hong, and he was beaten in the final of the Malaysia Open by another rising star, Lee Chong Wei. In his bid to capture his first BWF World title at Anaheim California, he beat Kennevic Asuncion, Shoji Sato, Lee Hyun-il, and Peter Gade in succession to reach the final. There he was decisively beaten by a peak-form Taufik Hidayat. Lin was also eliminated in the semifinals of the Singapore Open and the quarterfinals of the China Open.\\n\\n\\n=== 2006 ===\\nLin started the season by reaching the semifinals of the German Open, and had a same result in China Masters and China Open. He failed to win the Malaysia Open in June, which saw his opponent Lee Chong Wei produce a superb display to save the title after being 13–20 down in the deciding game, and also lost to Taufik Hidayat in Asian Games final.However, he won six individual titles in the season. He recaptured the All England Open, and won the Chinese Taipei, Macau, Hong Kong, and Japan Opens. Most significantly, in Madrid, Spain that September he won his first world title after beating his compatriot Bao Chunlai in the final.In May, Lin and his teammates had extended China\\'s Thomas Cup reign by shutting out Denmark 3–0 for a second consecutive title.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007 ===\\nLin Dan entered 2007 with a loss to South Korea\\'s Park Sung-hwan in the round of 16 at the Malaysia Open. A week later he captured the Korea Open by defeating Chinese teammate Chen Jin in the final. He went on to win the German Open and then the All England championships again, crushing compatriot Chen Yu 21–13, 21–12. In June, Lin Dan was part of the Chinese Sudirman Cup team that retained the cup after beating Indonesia 3–0 in the final at Glasgow, Scotland. Later in the season Lin Dan defeated Wong Choong Hann of Malaysia and became the China Masters champion for 2007. In August, Lin Dan extended his reign as the world champion when he beat Indonesia\\'s Sony Dwi Kuncoro 21–11, 22–20 in the final of the tournament held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Lin Dan thus became the first man since Yang Yang to win back to back world championships.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008 ===\\nLin started the season with a defeat in the final of the Korea Open to Lee Hyun-il. It was a match filled with controversy as Lin had a scuffle with South Korea\\'s coach Li Mao after a line call dispute. Lin refused to apologize and received no punishment from Badminton World Federation (BWF) after its probe of the altercation. In March he suffered another defeat to his compatriot Chen Jin in the final of the All England Open, which was followed by press accusations that Lin \"gave\" the match to Chen in order to increase Chen\\'s ranking points for Olympic qualification (which placed stringent limits on the number of participants from any one country). In the following week, Lin won his first Swiss Open. At the Asia Championships, Lin was again accused of helping his compatriot when his loss to Chen Jin in the semifinals ensured Chen\\'s qualification for the Olympic Games.On 10 April 2008, Lin was involved in yet another controversy when he struck coach Ji Xinpeng in front of his teammates and the media during an intra-squad tournament prior to the Thomas Cup. The incident was allegedly triggered by his unhappiness  with Ji\\'s arrangement of the starting line-up for the tournament. Despite the episode, in May Lin proceeded to win each match he played in the Thomas Cup until China\\'s semifinal clash with Malaysia when he lost rather tamely to Lee Chong Wei. However, China still managed to reach the final by edging Malaysia 3-2, then retained the cup against South Korea with Lin\\'s win at first singles helping China to a 3-1 victory.Lin won the Thailand Open, his last tournament before the 2008 Olympic Games.In the Beijing Olympic Games, he beat Hong Kong\\'s Ng Wei in the first round, Park Sung-hwan in the second round, and Peter Gade in the quarterfinals. He then beat his teammate Chen Jin in straight sets to set up a \"dream\" final against Lee Chong Wei. However, the final was a one-sided match as Lin demolished Lee 21–12, 21–8, and became the first men\\'s singles player to win the Olympic gold as a first seed.Not back in action until the China Open in November, Lin again beat Lee in the final, before losing to Chen Jin once again in the Hong Kong Open. Lin was eligible to participate in the lucrative Masters Finals in December, but due to the withdrawal of the whole Chinese contingent (citing weariness and injuries), he didn\\'t take part in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2009 ===\\nIn March, at his first tournament appearance of 2009, Lin won his fourth All England title without dropping a game, defeating Lee Chong Wei in the final. After this dominant performance, he lost to Lee in the final of Swiss Open a week later.In May, Lin participated in the Sudirman Cup helping China to consecutive 5–0 victories over England, Japan, and Indonesia. In the semifinals against Malaysia Lin defeated Lee Chong Wei in straight games as China advanced to the final against South Korea with another shutout. In the last round the same form held true as Lin beat Park Sung-hwan thus helping China to secure the Cup for the third time in a row, and each time without dropping a match in the series.During the rest of 2009 Lin dropped only two matches; in June in the quarterfinals of the Indonesia Open, and, perhaps most surprisingly, in the finals of December\\'s East Asian Games in Hong Kong to South Korea\\'s little known Choi Ho-jin. Aside from those upsets, Lin dominated. In August in Hyderabad he became the first player to win the World Championships three times by beating compatriot Chen Jin in the final. Later Dan would go on to win his fourth China Masters title and first French Open title. He ended his tournament winning streak in November with the China Open title before the late-year upset loss in Hong Kong.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010 ===\\n\\nAfter starting the season disappointingly with quarterfinal losses at both the All England and Swiss Opens, Lin won his first title of the year at the Badminton Asia Championships in New Delhi, which also marked his first victory at this annual event.Taking part in his fifth Thomas Cup campaign for China in May, Lin won a pair of hard fought encounters with South Korea\\'s Park Sung-hwan in the group ties and the quarterfinals respectively. In the semifinals, he handily defeated Lee Chong Wei in contributing to China\\'s 3-0 victory over Malaysia and a berth in the final against long time rival Indonesia. Here, Lin led off with a comfortable victory over familiar opponent Taufik Hidayat, as China went on to capture its eighth Men\\'s World Team title; its fourth consecutively.After the Thomas Cup triumph, Lin played in the World Championships in Paris, France. He won his opening match and then beat Henri Hurskainen and Bao Chunlai in the second and third rounds respectively before being upset by Park Sung-hwan in the quarterfinals. That day also saw his archrival Lee Chong Wei exit from the tournament which was eventually won by Lin\\'s compatriot Chen Jin. Lin then bounced back to win the China Masters, but \\nlost the final of the Japan Open to Lee Chong Wei the following week, and conceded walkovers in the quarterfinals of both the China Open, and Hong Kong Open late in the year.However, Lin managed to win his first ever Asian Games gold medal in November by beating Lee Chong Wei in final, thus, at 27, becoming the first player to win all of the present major titles available to Asian men in badminton, both individual and national team. Lin was voted the most valuable player (MVP) at the games\\' closing ceremony.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011 ===\\n\\nLin began the year with a withdrawal in the Malaysia Open\\'s quarterfinals, which marked his third consecutive withdrawal since late 2010. This action brought some criticism, particularly by well known fellow competitor Taufik Hidayat. The very next week Lin sprang back to win the first ever million dollar badminton tournament, Korea Open by beating Lee Chong Wei in the final. He next won the German Open, beating his compatriot and reigning world champion Chen Jin in the final.At the prestigious All England Championships in March his hopes for a fifth title were put on hold when he was defeated by Lee Chong Wei in the final. However, in April he won his second Asian Championships on a day which saw China sweep all five titles and in May he helped China to a fourth consecutive Sudirman Cup title by defeating Denmark 3–0 in the final. In June, Lin\\'s withdrawal from the Singapore Open final due to gastric flu drew jeers from fans in the stadium. Just few days later, he was upset by Sho Sasaki in the second round of Indonesia Open.Healthy again in August, Lin won his fourth World Championship title by beating familiar rivals Peter Gade in the semifinal and Lee Chong Wei in a very tight three game final at Wembley Arena, a venue which would host the badminton competition for 2012 Summer Olympics.The rather up and down season for Lin continued with the China Masters in September where he was ousted in the semi-finals, and at the Japan Open where he withdrew from the semifinals. This was followed up by a shock exit in the second round of the Denmark Open to Hong Kong player Wong Wing Ki, and another withdrawal during the semifinals of French Open despite leading in the match. He told officials that he was suffering from paronychia (an infection below the fingernail). This was his sixth retirement of the season and many in the media imputed that this was part of a strategy to improve the rankings of other Chinese singles players to allow the maximum number to qualify for the 2012 Olympics. Both Lin and Chinese coach Li Yongbo denied this, citing, instead, the heavy tournament schedule that BWF required of top players, and Lin\\'s need to be ready for the biggest events such as the Olympics. In any case, Lin\\'s slump did not last long. He ended the year by winning three straight events, His fifth Hong Kong Open, the China Open, and his first Super Series Masters Finals title.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012 ===\\n\\nLin started the year by losing to Lee Chong Wei in the final of the Korea Open, and then losing in the second round of the Malaysia Open to Denmark\\'s Jan O. Jorgensen. In early March he took his first title of the season by winning his fifth German Open. The very next week he won his fifth All England Open title as rival Lee Chong Wei was forced to retire in discomfort early in the second game of the final. In April, Lin was again the subject of some controversy when he withdrew from the semifinals of the Badminton Asia Championships, a move that was openly seen as a ploy to secure an Olympic berth for his compatriot Chen Jin.In Wuhan, China in May, Lin Dan and his teammates won all of their individual matches in each tie they played to win their fifth consecutive Thomas Cup (remarkably China\\'s women also went entirely undefeated to regain the Uber Cup from South Korea). With only a week between Thomas Cup and the Thailand Open in early June, a fatigued Lin lost in the semifinals to Indonesia\\'s highly capable Sony Dwi Kuncoro.At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Lin routinely beat Ireland\\'s Scott Evans to qualify for the main draw of sixteen players where he started by trouncing fading star Taufik Hidayat. In the quarterfinals, however, Japan\\'s hard-fighting Sho Sasaki put Lin to the test before yielding 16-21 in the third game. Lin then handily beat South Korean veteran Lee Hyun-il in the semifinals to set up yet another meeting with his chief rival Lee Chong Wei. Unlike the 2008 Olympic final this one was no cakewalk for Lin. He lost the first game to Lee but came back strongly to take the second. The rubber game was a thriller which saw Lin claw back from slight deficits most of the way to finally prevail 21-19  An ecstatic Lin thus became the first men\\'s singles player to retain the Olympic title, while Lee, now almost 30, was once again foiled at one of the sport\\'s two biggest events (aside from the Thomas and Uber Cups), the Olympics and the World Championships.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013 ===\\nAfter his 2012 Olympic victory Lin did not make another tournament appearance until the 2013 Badminton Asia Championships, in April where, citing injury, he withdrew from the quarterfinals. Amid some speculation that he was planning to retire, Lin was granted a special wild card entry into the World Championships in Guangzhou, as, despite his great achievements, his recent inactivity had caused his world ranking to fall below that of other Chinese players who would then normally fill the maximum quota of three entrants that any one country was allowed. Without appearing in any tournament between the Badminton Asia Champiohships in April and the World Championships in August, Lin was able to convert this wildcard entry into his fifth world title. He won all of his matches in straight games until the final where, yet again, hard-luck Lee Chong Wei could not quite catch him in the third game rubber, and was forced to submit with a painful cramp down 17-20.\\n\\n\\n=== 2014 ===\\nAfter seven month tournament absence Lin, down to 104th in the official world rankings, returned in April and took titles in the China Masters and the Badminton Asia Championships in quick succession. Lin was part of China\\'s Thomas Cup team which defended its title in May, but because of his deflated ranking could only play at third singles. Consequently, when China met a talented and highly motivated Japanese team in the semifinals at New Delhi, Lin could only watch helplessly as Japan took the first two singles and a doubles to break China\\'s ten year streak of men\\'s world team titles. Beyond this disappointment, the BWF would not grant Lin a wild card entry into the 2014 World Championships, as they did in 2013. Thus Lin could not defend his title which was won by Chinese teammate Chen Long who defeated the unlucky Lee Chong Wei in a close two game final.In June, Lin lost in the quarterfinals of Japan Open. Shortly afterwards, he won the Australian Open, his first Super Series title since the 2012 All England Open. In November, Lin lost in the final of the China Open  to Kidambi Srikanth from India.\\n\\n\\n=== 2015 ===\\nIn April, Lin won the men\\'s singles title at the Badminton Asia Championships in China, defending his title won the previous year in South Korea. He defeated compatriot Tian Houwei 21–19, 21–8 in a match that lasted 50 minutes in the central city of Wuhan. In May, Lin Dan contributed to China winning its 10th Sudirman Cup by defeating Japan\\'s Takuma Ueda 21–15, 21–13 in the final for his team\\'s third and decisive point. His return to the World Championships in August, however, was not particularly auspicious as he was routinely eliminated by Denmark\\'s Jan O. Jorgensen in the quarterfinals, as Lin\\'s compatriot Chen Long again prevailed over Lee Chong Wei in the finals. Recovering from this disappointment, in September Lin won his only Super Series title of the year at the Japan Open, making a remarkable comeback after trailing 3–11 in the deciding game of the final against Denmark\\'s young star Viktor Axelsen.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016 ===\\nIn March, Lin defeated Taiwan\\'s Chou Tien-Chen in three hard games to clinch his seventh men\\'s singles title at the German Open. A week after this win, Lin regained his All England title in Birmingham England, giving him his 6th victory at this prestigious event. In impressive form, he beat compatriot Tian Houwei 21–9, 21–10 in the final.In April, Lin Dan beat world No. 1 Chen Long in straight games to lift his sixth China Masters crown in Jiangsu, China. Here Lin showed his competitive mettle by coming from 11-16 behind in the second game to clinch the match 23-21. In June, however, he was stunned in second round of Indonesia Open by eighteen year old Jonatan Christie .At the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, Lin sailed through his group round robin to qualify for the main draw. In the quarterfinals he was tested by India\\'s Srikanth Kidambi, but pulled through 21-18 in the third game. This set up a semifinal confrontation with long-time rival Lee Chong Wei which drew great fan interest as the players, both in their thirties, were assumed to be near retirement. In another epic match Lee was finally able to reverse past Olympic and World Championship losses to Lin and prevail, 15–21, 21–11, 22–20. But Lee\\'s quest for Olympic gold after two silver medals ended with a disappointing finale, as he was beaten in two close games by Lin\\'s compatriot Chen Long. In the bronze medal match, Lin played Denmark\\'s Viktor Axelsen. After taking the first set 21–15, the two-time Olympic champion lost the next two and the match with a scoreline of 21–15, 10–21, 17–21. After the Rio Olympics, he skipped all international tournaments for the remainder of the year.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017 ===\\nIn March, at the prestigious All England Championships Lin defeated Viktor Axelson in the quarterfinals but was eliminated in the semifinals by his countryman Shi Yuqi, more than twelve years Lin\\'s Junior. However, he bounced back to win the Swiss Open by beating Shi Yuqi in the finals. In April he won the Malaysia Open for the first time by defeating Lee Chong Wei, who had virtually owned this title for more than a decade. In the China Masters he lost in the semifinal to Qiao Bin, and in the Badminton Asia Championship, where he recorded a semifinal win over Lee Chong Wei, he took a silver medal after a losing to Chen Long in the final. Lin was beaten in the German Open and Indonesian Open respectively in round of 16. He lost to Chen Long in the Australian Open semi finals.\\nAt the World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland, at age 33, Lin managed to reach a record seventh men\\'s singles final by beating Hong Kong\\'s Wong Wing Ki, 21–17, 21–18 in the quarter finals and beating Korea\\'s Son Wan-ho, 21–17, 21–14 in the semi finals. But in the finals, he was beaten in straight sets by his ten years younger opponent, Viktor Axelsen of Denmark, 22–20, 21–16.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018 ===\\nIn March, the 34-year-old Lin tied Rudy Hartono\\'s record of reaching ten All England  men\\'s singles finals, but was foiled in his try for a seventh title by his much younger compatriot, Shi Yuqi. In May he won the New Zealand Open by beating talented Indonesian youngster Jonatan Christie. Later that month Lin was a member of the Chinese team which regained the Thomas Cup after four year absence, though his team was never extended to a deciding 5th match which would have required his services in the third singles position.\\n\\n\\n=== 2019–2020 ===\\nAt 35, Lin Dan won his second Malaysia Open title in 2019, beating higher ranked compatriots Shi Yuqi and Chen Long in the semifinals and finals respectively. However, he withdrew from the Singapore Open during the first round against Viktor Axelsen, citing a \"thigh injury\", but only after being visibly upset by early line calls. In April, he lost in the semifinals of the New Zealand Open to Ng Ka Long. In September, he lost in the finals of the Korea Masters tournament to Kanta Tsuneyama. On 4 July 2020 Lin Dan announced his retirement, saying \"at 37, pain and injuries no longer allow me to fight with my teammates. I have gratitude, a heavy heart and unwillingness.\" After his retirement, he joined Instagram to stay connected with his fans all over the world.\\n\\n\\n== Rivalry with Lee Chong Wei ==\\n\\nThe Lee–Lin rivalry was a rivalry between two professional badminton players, Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan whose careers were almost exactly contemporaneous. The rivalry is often considered the greatest in the history of badminton even though Lin had the decided edge. Of their 40 meetings, Lin won the head to head by 28–12.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nLin was born in Fujian, China. At a young age, Lin Dan was encouraged to learn to play the piano by his parents, and to be a pianist. However, he chose to play badminton instead. Having started his training at the age of five, he was scouted by the People\\'s Liberation Army Sports Team after winning the National Junior Championships aged twelve, and was enlisted into the Chinese National Badminton Team in 2001, when he was 18.Lin has been in a relationship with Xie Xingfang, herself a former world champion, since 2003. They were quietly engaged on 13 December 2010 in Haizhu, Guangzhou. Xie initially denied but later acknowledged romantic involvement with Lin, who reacted angrily at the public exposure of their relationship, citing reasons of personal privacy. The two were married on 23 September 2012 and the wedding ceremony was held at the Beijing University of Technology.Lin had five tattoos visible during the 2012 Summer Olympics. His upper left arm has a Christian cross, his lower left arm has five stars, his right upper arm reads \"until the end of world\", a double \"F\" lettering on his lower right arm, and his initials \"LD\" are tattooed on the back of his neck. These tattoos have been the subject of controversy due to his military and religious status.On 17 October 2012, he became the first active Chinese badminton player to accept a master\\'s degree, which was presented at Huaqiao University. His autobiography, Until the End of the World, was published after he successfully defended his Olympic title at the London 2012 Olympics.\\n\\n\\n== Family ==\\nHe and his wife Xie Xingfang had their first child \"Xiao Yu\" (Little feather) on 5 November 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nLin won the Eddie Choong Player of the Year award for two consecutive years in 2006 and 2007. He also secured the BWF Best Male Player of the Year in 2008. Lin was voted Most Valuable Player (MVP) during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China.

She is from Tritonis, a city in the undersea lost continent of Atlantis, and first appeared in Superman #129. She was created by Bill Finger and Wayne Boring. Lori is one of several Superman characters with the alliterative initials \"LL\", including Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Lana Lang, Lyla Lerrol and Lucy Lane.\\n\\n\\n== Fictional character biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Silver Age ===\\nLori was first introduced in the story \"The Girl in Superman\\'s Past\" in Superman #129 (May 1959). The story revealed that while attending Metropolis University, Clark met Lori, who was attending as a student and hiding her mermaid identity by posing as a wheelchair-using student with a blanket covering the lower half of her body. Clark and Lori soon fell in love with each other, but Clark started to wonder why Lori would repeatedly cut their dates short every night to return home at 8 PM. Clark eventually decided to propose marriage to Lori, but Lori told Clark that she couldn\\'t marry him, and that she also had to return to her native country. Heartbroken, and growing suspicious of why Lori had to return home every night at a preset time, Clark investigated, and discovered Lori\\'s mermaid secret when he saw the tank of water in her room. Lori, in turn, revealed that thanks to her people\\'s telepathic powers, she knew that he was really Superman all along, but promised to keep the knowledge of his identity a secret. Lori also stated that since the two came from such different worlds, they could never be wed. After a parting kiss underwater, the two bid farewell to each other.Lori made various appearances throughout the Silver Age Superman comics. Like many other minor DC characters, Lori was killed in the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths.\\n\\n\\n=== Modern Age ===\\nLori was soon brought back in a new incarnation after John Byrne\\'s 1986 Man of Steel limited series, which revised Superman\\'s origins. Her post-Crisis incarnation first appeared in Superman (vol. 2) #12 in December 1987. Lori\\'s post-Crisis origin story and her relationship with Clark remained similar to the original, except that post-Crisis, Clark had not yet adopted a superheroic identity at the time he was in college. Additionally, in the modern version, Lori also had a mission to discover other cities of the continent of Atlantis, a quest completed when Superman later met Aquaman, who revealed he was a native of just such a city.In Lori\\'s appearances in the mid-to-late 1990s, Lori had been magically altered so that she would be human when dry and a mermaid when wet, much like Madison, Daryl Hannah\\'s character in the 1984 movie Splash. Lois Lane agreed to let her stay at her apartment for a while during a trip to Metropolis; however, Lori being an old flame of Clark\\'s put a brief strain on Lois and Clark\\'s relationship, though things were soon straightened out. Lori remained a recurring character through the rest of the 1990s. At one point she was accused of being a black market smuggler of underground artifacts and confronted by Daily Planet reporter Steve Lombard and a camera crew. To escape, she dove off a bridge and swam away. Not understanding her nature, Steve and the crew believed she committed suicide to escape the criminal charges leveled against her.Lemaris made an appearance in Justice Leagues, a Justice League of America comic event in 2001 involving her native Atlantis. In human form, her feet do not touch the ground, instead floating about an inch above it.\\nLori was thought to be killed in the 2005-2006 Infinite Crisis limited series when the out-of-control, magic-hating Spectre destroyed the kingdom of Atlantis. She appeared again after the Crisis\\' reality-altering events in a flashback story shown in 2007\\'s Superman Confidential #6-7.\\n\\n\\n== Other versions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Joker\\'s Wild ===\\nIn the Tangent Comics series Joker\\'s Wild, a human reporter named Lori Lemaris is one of three heroines masquerading as a heroic version of Joker. After one of her comrades dies in action, Lori refuses to wear the Joker outfit anymore, instead wearing the recently deceased Manhunter\\'s costume. She also appears in the Tangent: Superman\\'s Reign series (March 2008).\\n\\n\\n=== Superman: Year One ===\\nLori appears in the second issue of Frank Miller\\'s Superman: Year One limited series, which presents a new take on Superman\\'s origins.\\n\\n\\n== In other media ==\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\nLori makes a cameo appearance in the Young Justice episode \"Downtime\" voiced by an uncredited Kath Soucie.

It emerged from the friendship of three church groups: Pioneer, led by Gerald Coates; Ichthus led by Roger Forster; and Youth with a Mission led by Lynn Green. Together with the worship leader Graham Kendrick, they led a movement which over the next three years spread across the UK, Europe and North America, and finally across the world. Hundreds of smaller marches emerged in its wake.\\nThe initial expectation of 5,000 people was largely surpassed by the presence of 15,000 participants, boosting the realization of an edition of the event.By 1990, the March had already spread across 49 cities across the UK and also in Belfast (the capital of Northern Ireland), where 6,000 Catholics and Protestants gathered. It was estimated that approximately 200,000 religious participated in the event. The March quickly expanded to the other continents.\\nThe march was established in several countries of the world, especially in France in 1991, in the United States in 1992  and in Brazil in 1993, where it gathered 3 million people in São Paulo in 2019, one of the largest Christian gatherings in the world.\\n\\n\\n== Brazil ==\\n\\nIn order to gather faithful from various Protestant denominations, the March for Jesus is organized by the Church Reborn in Christ, Brazil (with the participation of other Neo-Pentecostal groups), the event brings to the street the churches, which march behind electric trios. With the participation of several states of Brazil, caravans (name designated to groups of travelers, pilgrims) from various places gather. Between 1994 and 2000 it was held as a global event, taking place in about 170 countries on the same date. The caravans meet at a certain point and go \"marching\" to the place where a stage is located for eventual shows, as occurred in São Paulo on May 31, 2018, In the year 2019, the event will take place on June 20, 2019; With departure 10 hours from the light meter and a day when thousands of faithful gathered in the Region of Light and went to the Heroes\\' Square, located near the Field of Mars, where the stage was set up.In 1993, the March For Jesus arrived in Brazil through the Apostle Estevam Hernandes, one of the founders of the Church Reborn in Christ. This year, the March For Jesus was held in more than 100 cities in various regions of Brazil. Six years later, about 10 million people from approximately 200 countries marched to celebrate the name of Jesus Christ. People of various religions, ages and ethnicities took to the streets of countries such as England, France, Germany, Italy, Northern Ireland, Egypt, Israel, USA, Canada, Russia, Cuba, Finland, Japan, Mozambique, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru and Chile. In 2013, the event was held for the first time in the Holy Land, Israel. The March for Jesus has been part of Brazil\\'s official calendar since September 2009, when Federal Law 12,025 was sanctioned by Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In 2015, the event was attended by approximately 340,000 people.\\n\\n\\n=== São Paulo ===\\nThe first Brazilian edition of the March for Jesus, held in the city of São Paulo in 1993, took about 350,000 people to the streets of the citycenter, bound for the Anhangabaú Valley, taking place a gospel show and collection of clothing. Since then, the event has been transferred to some regions of the city, most of them located in the North Zone of São Paulo. Gathering crowds every year, reaches the milestone of 1 million evangelicals participating in the year 2000. In 2005 the March was transferred to Paulista Avenue, where it was held for another year.\"Paulista receives today evangelical march\". In 2007, after a term signed between the Public Prosecutor\\'s Office of São Paulo and the government of Mayor Gilberto Kassab (DEM), there was a restriction on the holding of events on the Avenue, which, from this date, would host only three events per year.From this year the March began to be held in the neighborhoods of Bom Retiro and Santana, gathering more than three million participants annually. The march path begins in the central region of the city, at tiradentes subway station, follows Tiradentes Avenue, Ponte das Bandeiras, Avenida Santos Dumont, Campo de Bagatelle Square, and ends at Praça Heróis da FEB, Zona Norte. After the walk, accompanied by more than 10 electric trios, the participants gather at the concentration of the event, a stage set up in the Heroes Square of FEB, where gospel music shows are held. In 2008, Gilberto Kassab, mayor of the city, said the city was studying the possibility of transferring the event to the Interlagos Racetrack, where the 2009 edition would be. The decision, made due to complaints from the population living in the Campo de Bagatelle Square region, caused the discontent of the members of the Reborn in Christ Church, organizer of the March in the city of São Paulo. Thus, in 2010, the 18th March for Jesus took place in the North Zone of the city.\\nThe faithful met at tiradentes subway station, located on Line 1-Azul, and traveled 4 km until they reached the final point: Campo de Bagatelle Squarein Santana. There, the more than 2 million participants were able to accompany musical performances by French singer Chris Durán, and artists such as Soraya Moraes, Renascer Praise, DJ Alpiste, FLG Quartet, Touch the Altar and Brother Lazarus. The Military Police (PM) said that 2 million people participated in the event. In the following editions, the site was maintained. In 2011, the PM confirmed 1.5 million participants in the March for Jesus, a number that fell to 335,000 in 2012, according to a survey conducted by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. In the following years, the number of participants became unstable — according to the Military Police, 800,000 people participated in 2013 and 200,000 in 2014; in 2015, the PM counted 340,000, but in 2016 did not disclose the number of participants and the organization of the event estimated that 3 million people attended to walk the path of approximately four kilometers. In 2017 is scheduled for the fifteenth of June, the holiday of corpus christi, the Christian event. The event has free admission. In the light subway station, outside, the participants meet, so that they can walk together to the end of the March for Jesus, in heroes square feb. The event will start at ten o\\'clock in the morning. The organization of the event advises people not to stand at the subway door, so as to avoid inconvenience in the entry and exit of people at the station, and that adults who are accompanied by children, identify them, with the name and telephone number of the person responsible, and their respective name. The 2017 edition celebrates twenty-five years of March to Jesus and will have several attractions in the Heroes Square of FEB. Among them the bands \"Ao Cubo\", \"Banda Dopa\", \"Bruna Karla\", \"Damares\", \"Eli Soares\", \"Fernando Urias\", \"Marcela Tais\", \"Juliana Santiago\", Milena and Xuxu\", Nanan Shara and PR Brinco\", among other attractions.

Along with Henry Taylor of the United Kingdom, he was the most successful athlete at the 1908 Olympics.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nBorn in the Almonesson section of Deptford Township, New Jersey, he moved from there with his family to Clayton at the age of nine and worked in a glass factory before moving to Haddonfield and then the Grays Ferry neighborhood of Philadelphia during his mid-teens.  Sheppard, or \"Peerless Mel\" as he was nicknamed, was rejected by the New York Police because he had a slightly enlarged heart. Cardiopulmonary problems notwithstanding, Sheppard won three consecutive AAU titles in the 880 yards (805 m) from 1906 to 1908 and became a main favorite for the middle distance events at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. By late 1907 Sheppard held the world indoor records for 600 yards, 880 yards, 1000 yards and the mile.\\n\\n\\n=== Sheppard and Guy Haskins ===\\nDuring the indoor season of 1907/08 Sheppard raced Guy Haskins 3 times and losing all 3. In the first he was well beaten, in the second when about to be beaten again he threw Haskins to the floor with a flying mare (which he also did to another runner,  Adam O\\'Shea, in the Millrose Games) and was disqualified, and in the third he walked off the track when about to be beaten again. By May the New York Times reported that Haskins, \"unquestionably the best half-mile and mile performer in the country\", had been refused selection for the United States team to the 1908 Olympics for which he had been trying. He was not selected for the Australasian team either, largely for financial reasons.\\n\\n\\n== 1908 Olympic Games ==\\n\\nThe 1908 Olympics were the first true championships for the 1500 metres, as the previous Olympics were not well attended by the top milers of the day. However, the heats for the final were capricious in their format: only the winner of each of the eight heats would qualify for the final, and there was no seeding to ensure that top runners were separated in their heats. Accordingly, top runners like 1904 and 1906 Olympic champion James Lightbody, John Halstead, second-fastest in history in the event and three-time AAA champion George Butterfield all failed to advance.\\nSheppard won the 1500 metres, setting an Olympic record at 4:05.0 in the first round that fell in the very next heat, when Norman Hallows ran a 4:03.6. Sheppard matched Hallows\\' time in the final the next day to win the first running gold medal awarded at the 1908 Games.\\nIn the 800 metres, Sheppard won his first round (semifinal) heat with a time of 1:58.0; James Lintott remained close throughout the race and threatened to eliminate Sheppard from the competition. Noted for being a frontrunner, Sheppard ran the first 400 metres of the 800 metres final in 53 seconds and went on to win in the world record time of 1.52.8.\\nHe earned his third gold medal on the medley relay race. He was the final runner on the American team, running fully half of the 1600 metre race. He was passed the baton by fellow Irish American Athletic Club member John Baxter Taylor, Jr., who would become the first African-American to win an Olympic gold medal. Even without being in as good of form as he had been in the individual races, Sheppard had little trouble retaining the leads giving to him by his teammates, William Hamilton, Nate Cartmell, and John Taylor. The team won both the first round and final, in times of 3:27.2 and 3:29.4. Sheppard\\'s 800 metre split for the final was 1:55.4.\\n\\n\\n== 1 Mile Relay World\\'s Record ==\\nAt the Amateur Athletic Union metropolitan championships held at Travers Island in 1909,  Sheppard was part of the Irish American Athletic Club\\'s four-man relay team that broke the world\\'s record for the one mile relay, with a time of 3 minutes 20 2/5 seconds. The other three men on the record breaking team were; C.S. Cassara, William Robbins and James Rosenberger. His 1910 trading card called him \"undoubtedly the greatest mid-distance runner the world has ever seen.\"\\n\\n\\n== 1912 Olympic Games ==\\n\\nAfter winning Amateur Athletic Union titles at 880 yards (800 m) in 1911 and 1912, Sheppard was a favourite to defend his Olympic 800 metres title at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. At Stockholm, he tried the same tactics as in London, but after an opening lap of 52.4, he was overtaken by teammate Ted Meredith who set a new world record of 1.51.9. Sheppard won his fourth gold medal as lead-off runner on the 4 × 400 m relay team that set a world record of 3:16.6.\\n\\n\\n== Post-competition career ==\\nSheppard was a member of the New Jersey National Guard and the 69th Regiment. During World War I, he served as an athletic director at a number of military training camps. After the war he coached for a number of amateur athletic clubs. Sheppard worked for John Wanamaker and was the recreational director for the Millrose A.A., which was formed by Wanamaker\\'s employees. Sheppard coached the U.S. women\\'s track and field team at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.:\\u200a154\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nSheppard died at his home in Bayside, Queens, New York City. He was buried in New Camden Cemetery in Camden, New Jersey. His obituary cites \"acute indigestion\" as the cause of death. He was survived by his wife Estelle (née) Symon, his daughter Adelaide Kohler of Wildwood, New Jersey and his son Melvin Sheppard Jr., who was on the track and cross-country team at Princeton University in 1932.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nWhile it is widely claimed that \"after retiring from sports Sheppard became a lawyer (he was one of the defenders of the Lindbergh child kidnapper Bruno Hauptmann)\" this is apparently an Internet myth. The lead attorney for Bruno Hauptmann was a Mr. Edward J. Reilly.  \"The Trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann,\" by Sidney B. Whipple, (originally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., NY, 1937) makes no mention of Sheppard.  Whipple lists the defense team present for the first day of trial as \"Mr. Reilly, Mr. Fisher, Mr. Pope, Mr. Rosecrans.\"  There is no evidence that Mel Sheppard ever practiced law, or had anything to do with the Lindbergh child kidnapper.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nCook, Theodore Andrea (May 1909).

His usual depiction, based on an amalgamation of historic and legendary figures, was introduced by the 12th-century British author Geoffrey of Monmouth. It is believed that Geoffrey combined earlier tales of Myrddin and Ambrosius, two legendary Briton prophets with no connection to Arthur, to form the composite figure called Merlinus Ambrosius (Welsh: Myrddin Emrys, Breton: Merzhin Ambroaz).\\nGeoffrey\\'s rendering of the character became immediately popular, especially in Wales. Later writers in France and elsewhere expanded the account to produce a fuller image, creating one of the most important figures in the imagination and literature of the Middle Ages.\\nMerlin\\'s traditional biography casts him as a cambion, a being born of a mortal woman, sired by an incubus, from whom he inherits his supernatural powers and abilities, most commonly and notably prophecy and shapeshifting. Merlin matures to an ascendant sagehood and engineers the birth of Arthur through magic and intrigue. Later authors have Merlin serve as the king\\'s advisor and mentor until he disappears from the story after having been bewitched and forever sealed or killed by his student known as the Lady of the Lake after falling madly in love with her, leaving behind a series of prophecies foretelling the events yet to come. He is popularly said to be buried in the magical forest of Brocéliande.\\n\\n\\n== Name ==\\n\\nThe name \"Merlin\" is derived from the Brythonic Myrddin, the name of the bard who was one of the chief sources for the later legendary figure. Geoffrey of Monmouth Latinised the name to Merlinus in his works. Medievalist Gaston Paris suggests that Geoffrey chose the form Merlinus rather than the expected *Merdinus to avoid a resemblance to the Anglo-Norman word merde (from Latin merda) for feces. A more plausible suggestion is that \\'Merlin\\' is an adjective and that consequently we should be speaking of \"The Merlin\", from the French merle meaning \\'blackbird\\',:\\u200a79\\u200a or that the \\'many names\\' deriving from Myrddin stem from the Welsh: myrdd: myriad.Clas Myrddin or Merlin\\'s Enclosure is an early name for Great Britain stated in the Third Series of Welsh Triads. Celticist A. O. H. Jarman suggests that the Welsh name Myrddin (Welsh pronunciation: [ˈmərðin]) was derived from the toponym Caerfyrddin, the Welsh name for the town known in English as Carmarthen. This contrasts with the popular folk etymology that the town was named after the bard. The name Carmarthen is derived from the town\\'s previous Roman name Moridunum, in turn derived from Celtic Brittonic moridunon, \\'sea fortress\\'.\\n\\n\\n== Medieval legend ==\\n\\n\\n=== Geoffrey and his sources ===\\n\\nGeoffrey\\'s composite Merlin is based mostly on the North Brythonic poet and seer Myrddin Wyllt, that is \"Myrddin the Wild\" (known as Merlinus Caledonensis or Merlin Sylvestris in later texts influenced by Geoffrey).  Myrddin\\'s legend has parallels with a Welsh and Scottish story of the mad prophet Lailoken (Laleocen), and with Buile Shuibhne, an Irish tale of the wandering insane king Suibhne (Sweeney).:\\u200a58\\u200a In Welsh poetry, Myrddin was a bard driven mad after witnessing the horrors of war, who fled civilization to become a wild man of the wood in the 6th century. He roams the Caledonian Forest, until cured of his madness by Kentigern (Saint Mungo). Geoffrey had Myrddin in mind when he wrote his earliest surviving work, the Prophetiae Merlini (\"Prophecies of Merlin\", c. 1130), which he claimed were the actual words of the legendary poet, however revealing little about Merlin\\'s background.\\nGeoffrey was also further inspired by Emrys (Old Welsh: Embreis), a character based in part on the 5th-century historical figure of the Romano-British war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus. When Geoffrey included Merlin in his next work, Historia Regum Britanniae (c. 1136), he supplemented his characterisation by attributing to Merlin stories concerning Ambrosius, taken from one of his primary sources, the early 9th-century Historia Brittonum attributed to Nennius. In Nennius\\' account, Ambrosius was discovered when the British king Vortigern attempted to erect a tower at Dinas Emrys. More than once, the tower collapsed before completion. Vortigen\\'s wise men advised him that the only solution was to sprinkle the foundation with the blood of a child born without a father. Ambrosius was rumoured to be such a child. When brought before the king, Ambrosius revealed that below the foundation of the tower was a lake containing two dragons battling into each other, representing the struggle between the invading Saxons and the native Celtic Britons. Geoffrey retold the story in his Historia Regum Britanniæ, adding new episodes that tie Merlin with King Arthur and his predecessors. Geoffrey stated that this Ambrosius was also called \"Merlin\", therefore Ambrosius Merlinus, and kept him separate from Aurelius Ambrosius.\\n\\nTherefore, Geoffrey\\'s account of Merlin Ambrosius\\' early life is based on the story from the Historia Brittonum. Geoffrey added his own embellishments to the tale, which he set in Carmarthen, Wales (Welsh: Caerfyrddin). While Nennius\\' \"fatherless\" Ambrosius eventually reveals himself to be the son of a Roman consul, Geoffrey\\'s Merlin is begotten by an incubus demon on a daughter of the King of Dyfed (Demetae, today\\'s South West Wales). Usually, the name of Merlin\\'s mother is not stated, but is given as Adhan in the oldest version of the Prose Brut, the text also naming his grandfather as King Conaan. The story of Vortigern\\'s tower is the same; the underground dragons, one white and one red, represent the Saxons and the Britons, and their final battle is a portent of things to come. At this point Geoffrey inserted a long section of Merlin\\'s prophecies, taken from his earlier Prophetiae Merlini. He told two further tales of the character. In the first, Merlin creates Stonehenge as a burial place for Aurelius Ambrosius, bringing the stones from Ireland. In the second, Merlin\\'s magic enables the new British king Uther Pendragon to enter into Tintagel Castle in disguise and to father his son Arthur with his enemy\\'s wife, Igerna (Igraine). These episodes appear in many later adaptations of Geoffrey\\'s account. As Lewis Thorpe notes, Merlin disappears from the narrative subsequently. He does not tutor and advise Arthur as in later versions.Geoffrey dealt with Merlin again in his third work, Vita Merlini (1150). He based it on stories of the original 6th-century Myrddin, set long after his time frame for the life of Merlin Ambrosius. Geoffrey asserts that the characters and events of Vita Merlini are the same as told in the Historia Regum Britanniae. Here, Merlin survives the reign of Arthur, about the fall of whom he is told by Taliesin. Merlin spends a part of his life as a madman in the woods and marries a woman named Guendoloena (inspired by the male Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio).:\\u200a44\\u200a He eventually retires to observing stars from his esplumoir, a house with seventy windows in the remote woods of Rhydderch. There, he is often visited by Taliesin and by his own sister Ganieda (based on Myrddin\\'s sister Gwenddydd), who has become queen of the Cumbrians and is also endowed with prophetic powers.\\n\\nNikolai Tolstoy hypothesized that Merlin is based on a historical personage, probably a 6th-century druid living in southern Scotland. His argument was based on the fact that early references to Merlin describe him as possessing characteristics which modern scholarship (but not that of the time the sources were written) would recognize as druidical, the inference being that those characteristics were not invented by the early chroniclers, but belonged to a real person. If so, the hypothetical Merlin would have lived about a century after the hypothetical historical Arthur. A late version of the Annales Cambriae (dubbed the \"B-text\", written at the end of the 13th century) and influenced by Geoffrey, records for the year 573, that after \"the battle of Arfderydd, between the sons of Eliffer and Gwenddolau son of Ceidio; in which battle Gwenddolau fell; Merlin went mad.\" The earliest version of the Annales Cambriae entry (in the \"A-text\", written c. 1100), as well as a later copy (the \"C-text\", written towards the end of the 13th century) do not mention Merlin. Myrddin/Merlin furthermore shares similarities with the shamanic bard figure of Taliesin, alongside whom he appears in the Welsh Triads and in Vita Merlini, as well as in the poem \"The Ymddiddan Myrddin a Thaliesin\" (\"The Conversation between Myrddin and Taliesin\") from The Black Book of Carmarthen. \\n\\n\\n=== Later developments ===\\n\\nSometime around the turn of the next century, Robert de Boron retold and expanded on this material in Merlin, an Old French poem presenting itself as the story of Merlin\\'s life as told by Merlin himself to the author. Only a few lines of what is believed to be the original text have survived, but a more popular prose version had a great influence on the emerging genre of Arthurian-themed chivalric romance. In Robert\\'s account, as in Geoffrey\\'s Historia, Merlin is created as a demon spawn, but here explicitly to become the Antichrist intended to reverse the effect of the Harrowing of Hell. This infernal plot is thwarted when a priest named Blaise (who is also figuring within the text as the supposedly \"actual\" author, decades later writing down Merlin\\'s own words in a third-person narration) is contacted by the child\\'s mother. Blaise immediately baptizes the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny. The demonic legacy invests Merlin (already able to speak fluently even as a newborn) with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. The text lays great emphasis on Merlin\\'s power to shapeshift, on his joking personality, and on his connection to the Holy Grail, the quest for which he foretells. Inspired by Wace\\'s Roman de Brut, an Anglo-Norman adaptation of Geoffrey\\'s Historia, Merlin was originally a part of a cycle of Robert\\'s poems telling the story of the Grail over the centuries. The narrative of Merlin is largely based on Geoffrey\\'s familiar tale of Vortigern\\'s Tower, Uther\\'s war against the Saxons, and Arthur\\'s conception. What follows is a new episode of the young Arthur\\'s drawing of the sword from the stone, an event orchestrated by Merlin. Merlin also earlier instructs Uther to establish the original order of the Round Table, after creating the table itself. The prose version of Robert\\'s poem was then continued in the 13th-century Merlin Continuation or the Suite de Merlin, describing King Arthur\\'s early wars and Merlin\\'s role in them as he predicts and influences the course of battles (this is depicted in more detail in the recently-found Bristol Merlin fragment). He also helps Arthur in other ways, including providing him with the magic sword Excalibur through a Lady of the Lake. Here too Merlin\\'s shapeshifting powers feature prominently.\\n\\nThe extended prose rendering became the foundation for the Lancelot-Grail, a vast cyclical series of Old French prose works also known as the Vulgate Cycle. Eventually, it was directly incorporated into the Vulgate Cycle as the Estoire de Merlin, also known as the Vulgate Merlin or the Prose Merlin. A further reworking and continuation of the Prose Merlin was included within the subsequent Post-Vulgate Cycle as the Post-Vulgate Suite du Merlin or the Huth Merlin. All these variants have been adapted and translated into several other languages, and further modified. Notably, the Post-Vulgate Suite (along with an earlier version of the Prose Merlin) was the main source for the opening part of Thomas Malory\\'s English-language compilation work Le Morte d\\'Arthur that formed a now-iconic version of the legend. Compared to his French sources, Malory limited the extent of the negative association of Merlin and his powers, relatively rarely being condemned as demonic by other characters such as King Lot. Conversely, Merlin seems to be inherently evil in the so-called non-cyclic Lancelot, where he was born as the \"fatherless child\" from not a supernatural rape of a virgin but a consensual union between a lustful demon and an unmarried beautiful young lady, and was never baptized.  The Prose Lancelot further relates that, after growing up in the borderlands between Scotland (Pictish lands) and Ireland (Argyll), Merlin \"possessed all the wisdom that can come from demons, which is why he was so feared by the Bretons and so revered that everyone called him a holy prophet and the ordinary people all called him their god.\"\\n\\nAs the Arthurian myths were retold, Merlin\\'s prophetic aspects were sometimes de-emphasised in favour of portraying him as a wizard and an advisor to the young Arthur, sometimes in struggle between good and evil sides of his character, and living in deep forests connected with nature. Through his ability to change his shape, he may appear as a \"wild man\" figure evoking that of his prototype Myrddin Wyllt, as a civilized man of any age, or even as a talking animal. In the Perceval en prose (also known as the Didot Perceval and too attributed to Robert), where Merlin is the initiator of the Grail Quest, he eventually retires by turning himself into a bird. In the Vulgate Cycle\\'s version of Merlin, his acts include arranging consummation of Arthur\\'s desire for \"the most beautiful maiden ever born,\" Lady Lisanor of Cardigan, resulting in the birth of Arthur\\'s illegitimate son Lohot from before the marriage to Guinevere. But fate cannot always be changed: the Post-Vulgate Cycle has Merlin warn Arthur of how the birth of his other son will bring great misfortune and ruin to his kingdom, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Eventually, long after Merlin is gone, his advice to dispose of the baby Mordred through an event evoking the Biblical Massacre of the Innocents leads to the deaths of many, among them Arthur.\\nThe earliest English verse romance concerning Merlin is Of Arthour and of Merlin, which drew from the chronicles and the Vulgate Cycle. In English-language medieval texts that conflate Britain with the Kingdom of England, the Anglo-Saxon enemies against whom Merlin aids first Uther and then Arthur tend to be replaced by the Saracens or simply just invading pagans. Some of the many Welsh works predicting the Celtic revenge and victory over the Saxons have been also reinterpreted as Merlin\\'s (Myrddin\\'s) prophecies, and later used by propaganda of the Welsh-descent king Henry VIII of England in the 16th century. The House of Tudor, which traced their lineage directly to Arthur, interpreted the prophecy of King Arthur\\'s return figuratively as concerning their ascent to the throne of England that they sought to legitimise following the Wars of the Roses.\\nMany other medieval works dealing with the Merlin legend include an unusual story of the 13th-century Le Roman de Silence. The Prophéties de Merlin (c. 1276) contains long prophecies of Merlin (mostly concerned with 11th to 13th-century Italian history and contemporary politics), some by his ghost after his death, interspersed with episodes relating Merlin\\'s deeds and with assorted Arthurian adventures in which Merlin does not appear at all. Even more political Italian text was Joachim of Fiore\\'s Expositio Sybillae et Merlini, directed against Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor whom the author regarded as the Antichrist. The earliest Merlin text in German was Caesarius of Heisterbach\\'s Dialogus Miraculorum (1220), originally in Latin. Ulrich Füetrer\\'s 15th-century Buch der Abenteuer presents Merlin as Uter\\'s father, effectively making his grandson Arthur a part-devil too. Conversely, the 13th-14th Italian story collection Il Novellino pictures Merlin as a righteous seer chastising people for their sins.  \\n\\n\\n=== Tales of Merlin\\'s end ===\\n\\nIn chivalric romance tradition, Merlin has a major weakness that leads him to his relatively early doom: young beautiful women of femme fatale archetype. His apprentice is often Arthur\\'s half-sister Morgan le Fay (in the Prophéties de Merlin along with Sebile and two other witch queens and the Lady of the Isle of Avalon (Dama di Isola do Vallone); the others who have learnt sorcery from Merlin include the Wise Damsel in the Italian Historia di Merlino, and the male wizard Mabon in the Post-Vulgate Merlin Continuation and the Prose Tristan). While Merlin does share his magic with his apprentices, his prophetic powers cannot be passed on. As for Morgan, she is sometimes depicted as Merlin\\'s lover and sometimes as just an unrequited love interest. Contrary to the many modern works in which they are archenemies, Merlin and Morgan are never opposed to each other in any medieval tradition, other than Morgan forcibly rejecting him in some texts; in fact, his love for Morgan is so great that he even lies to the king in order to save her in the Huth Merlin, which is the only instance of him ever intentionally misleading Arthur. Instead, Merlin\\'s eventual undoing comes from his lusting after another of his female students: the one often named Viviane, among various other names and spellings, including Malory\\'s (or really his editor Caxton\\'s) now-popular form Nimue (originally Nymue). She is also called a fairy (French fee) like Morgan and described as a Lady of the Lake (the \"chief Lady of the Lake\" in case of Malory\\'s Nimue). Malory\\'s telling of this episode would later become a major inspiration for Romantic authors and artists of the 19th century.\\n\\nViviane\\'s character in relation with Merlin is first found in the Lancelot-Grail cycle, after having been inserted into the legend of Merlin by either de Boron or his continuator. There are many different versions of their story. Common themes in most of them include Merlin actually having the prior prophetic knowledge of her plot against him (one exception is the Spanish Post-Vulgate Baladro where his foresight ability is explicitly dampened by sexual desire) but lacking either ability or will to counteract it in any way, along with her using one of his own spells to rid of him. Usually (including in Le Morte d\\'Arthur), having learnt everything she could from him, Viviane will then also replace the eliminated Merlin within the story, taking up his role as Arthur\\'s adviser and court mage. However, Merlin\\'s fate of either demise or eternal imprisonment, along with his destroyer or captor\\'s motivation (from her fear of Merlin and protecting her own virginity, to her jealously for his relationship with Morgan), is recounted differently in variants of this motif. The exact form of his either prison or grave can be also variably a cave, a hole under a large rock (as in Le Morte d\\'Arthur), a magic tower, or a tree. These are usually placed within the enchanted forest of Brocéliande, a legendary location often identified as the real-life Paimpont forest in Brittany.Niniane, as the Lady of the Lake student of Merlin is known as in the Livre d\\'Artus continuation of Merlin, is mentioned as having broken his heart prior to his later second relationship with Morgan, but here the text actually does not tell how exactly Merlin did vanish, other than relating his farewell meeting with Blaise. In the Vulgate Lancelot, which predated the later Vulgate Merlin, she (aged just 12 at the time) makes Merlin sleep forever in a pit in the forest of Darnantes, \"and that is where he remained, for never again did anyone see or hear of him or have news to tell of him.\" In the Post-Vulgate Suite de Merlin, the young King Bagdemagus (one of the early Knights of the Round Table) manages to find the rock under which Merlin is entombed alive by Niviene, as she is named there. He communicates with Merlin, but is unable to lift the stone; what follows next is supposedly narrated in the mysterious text Conte del Brait (Tale of the Cry). In the Prophéties de Merlin version, his tomb is unsuccessfully searched for by various parties, including by Morgan and her enchantresses, but cannot be accessed due to the deadly magic traps around it, while the Lady of the Lake comes to taunt Merlin by asking did he rot there yet. One notably alternate version having a happier ending for Merlin is contained within the Premiers Faits section of the Livre du Graal, where Niniane peacefully confines him in Brocéliande with walls of air, visible only as a mist to others but as a beautiful yet unbreakable crystal tower to him (only Merlin\\'s disembodied voice can escape his prison one last time when speaks to Gawain on the knight\\'s quest to find him), where they will then spend almost every night together as lovers. Besides evoking the final scenes from Vita Merlini, this particular variant of their story also mirrors episodes found in some other texts, wherein Merlin either is an object of one-sided desire by a different amorous sorceress who too (unsuccessfully) plots to trap him or it is actually Merlin himself who traps an unwilling lover with his magic.\\nUnrelated to the legend of the Lady of the Lake, other purported sites of Merlin\\'s burial include a cave deep inside Merlin\\'s Hill (Welsh: Bryn Myrddin), outside Carmarthen. Carmarthen is also associated with Merlin more generally, including through the 13th-century manuscript known as the Black Book and the local lore of Merlin\\'s Oak. In North Welsh tradition, Merlin retires to Bardsey Island (Welsh: Ynys Enlli), where he lives in a house of glass (Welsh: Tŷ Gwydr) with the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Welsh: Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain).:\\u200a200\\u200a One site of his tomb is said to be Marlborough Mound in Wiltshire, known in medieval times as Merlebergia (the Abbot of Cirencester wrote in 1215: \"Merlin\\'s tumulus gave you your name, Merlebergia\":\\u200a93\\u200a). Another site associated with Merlin\\'s burial, in his \\'Merlin Silvestris\\' aspect, is the confluence of the Pausalyl Burn and River Tweed in Drumelzier, Scotland. The 15th-century Scotichronicon tells that Merlin himself underwent a triple-death, at the hands of some shepherds of the under-king Meldred: stoned and beaten by the shepherds, he falls over a cliff and is impaled on a stake, his head falls forward into the water, and he drowns. The fulfilment of another prophecy, ascribed to Thomas the Rhymer, came about when a spate of the Tweed and Pausayl occurred during the reign of the Scottish James VI and I on the English throne: \"When Tweed and Pausayl meet at Merlin\\'s grave, / Scotland and England one king shall have.\":\\u200a62\\u200a \\n\\n\\n== Modern fiction ==\\n\\nMerlin and stories involving him have continued to be popular from the Renaissance to the present day, especially since the renewed interest in the legend of Arthur in modern times. As noted by Arthurian scholar Alan Lupack, \"numerous novels, poems and plays centre around Merlin. In American literature and popular culture, Merlin is perhaps the most frequently portrayed Arthurian character.\" Diverting from his traditional role in the legends, Merlin is sometimes portrayed as a villain, as in Mark Twain\\'s humorous novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\\'s Court (1889). \\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n2598 Merlin, an asteroid named in honour of the legendary figure\\nMerlin\\'s Cave, a location under Tintagel Castle\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Bibliography ===\\nGoodrich, Peter H.

The common name comes from William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1842 using a 36-inch (91 cm) telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. The nebula was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731, and it corresponds with a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified that corresponds with a historical supernova explosion.\\nAt an apparent magnitude of 8.4, comparable to that of Saturn\\'s moon Titan, it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using binoculars under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of about 2.0 kiloparsecs (6,500 ly) from Earth. It has a diameter of 3.4 parsecs (11 ly), corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7 arcminutes, and is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometres per second (930 mi/s), or 0.5% of the speed of light.\\nAt the center of the nebula lies the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 28–30 kilometres (17–19 mi) across with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second, which emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves. At X-ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV, the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent gamma-ray source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 TeV. The nebula\\'s radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun\\'s corona was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula\\'s radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn\\'s moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.\\n\\n\\n== Observational history ==\\n\\nModern understanding that the Crab Nebula was created by a supernova traces back to 1921, when Carl Otto Lampland announced he had seen changes in the nebula\\'s structure. This \\neventually led to the conclusion that the creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright SN 1054 supernova recorded by ancient astronomers in AD 1054.\\n\\n\\n=== First identification ===\\nThe Crab Nebula was first identified in 1731 by John Bevis. The nebula was independently rediscovered in 1758 by Charles Messier as he was observing a bright comet. Messier catalogued it as the first entry in his catalogue of comet-like objects; in 1757, Alexis Clairaut reexamined the calculations of Edmund Halley and predicted the return of Halley\\'s Comet in late 1758. The exact time of the comet\\'s return required the consideration of perturbations to its orbit caused by planets in the Solar System such as Jupiter, which Clairaut and his two colleagues Jérôme Lalande and Nicole-Reine Lepaute carried out more precisely than Halley, finding that the comet should appear in the constellation of Taurus. It was in searching in vain for the comet that Charles Messier found the Crab Nebula, which he at first thought to be Halley\\'s comet. After some observation, noticing that the object that he was observing was not moving across the sky, Messier concluded that the object was not a comet. Messier then realised the usefulness of compiling a catalogue of celestial objects of a cloudy nature, but fixed in the sky, to avoid incorrectly cataloguing them as comets. This realization led him to compile the \"Messier catalogue\".\\n\\nWilliam Herschel observed the Crab Nebula numerous times between 1783 and 1809, but it is not known whether he was aware of its existence in 1783, or if he discovered it independently of Messier and Bevis. After several observations, he concluded that it was composed of a group of stars. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse observed the nebula at Birr Castle in 1844 using a 36-inch (0.9 m) telescope, and referred to the object as the \"Crab Nebula\" because a drawing he made of it looked like a crab. He observed it again later, in 1848, using a 72-inch (1.8 m) telescope but could not confirm the supposed resemblance, but the name stuck nevertheless.\\n\\n\\n=== Connection to SN 1054 ===\\n\\nThe Crab Nebula was the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion. In the early twentieth century, the analysis of early photographs of the nebula taken several years apart revealed that it was expanding. Tracing the expansion back revealed that the nebula must have become visible on Earth about 900 years before. Historical records revealed that a new star bright enough to be seen in the daytime had been recorded in the same part of the sky by Chinese astronomers on 4 July 1054, and probably also by Japanese observers.In 1913, when Vesto Slipher registered his spectroscopy study of the sky, the Crab Nebula was again one of the first objects to be studied. Changes in the cloud, suggesting its small extent, were discovered by Carl Lampland in 1921. That same year, John Charles Duncan demonstrated that the remnant is expanding, while Knut Lundmark noted its proximity to the guest star of 1054.In 1928, Edwin Hubble proposed associating the cloud with the star of 1054, an idea that remained controversial until the nature of supernovae was understood, and it was Nicholas Mayall who indicated that the star of 1054 was undoubtedly the supernova whose explosion produced the Crab Nebula. The search for historical supernovae started at that moment: seven other historical sightings have been found by comparing modern observations of supernova remnants with astronomical documents of past centuries. \\nAfter the original connection to Chinese observations, in 1934 connections were made to a 13th-century Japanese reference to a \"guest star\" in Meigetsuki a few weeks before the Chinese reference. The event was long considered unrecorded in Islamic astronomy, but in 1978 a reference was found in a 13th-century copy made by Ibn Abi Usaibia of a work by Ibn Butlan, a Nestorian Christian physician active in Baghdad at the time of the supernova.Given its great distance, the daytime \"guest star\" observed by the Chinese could only have been a supernova—a massive, exploding star, having exhausted its supply of energy from nuclear fusion and collapsed in on itself. Recent analysis of historical records have found that the supernova that created the Crab Nebula probably appeared in April or early May, rising to its maximum brightness of between apparent magnitude −7 and −4.5 (brighter even than Venus\\' −4.2 and everything in the night sky except the Moon) by July. The supernova was visible to the naked eye for about two years after its first observation.\\n\\n\\n=== Crab Pulsar ===\\n\\nIn the 1960s, because of the prediction and discovery of pulsars, the Crab Nebula again became a major center of interest. It was then that Franco Pacini predicted the existence of the Crab Pulsar for the first time, which would explain the brightness of the cloud. The star was observed shortly afterwards in 1968. The discovery of the Crab Pulsar, and the knowledge of its exact age (almost to the day) allows for the verification of basic physical properties of these objects, such as characteristic age and spin-down luminosity, the orders of magnitude involved (notably the strength of the magnetic field), along with various aspects related to the dynamics of the remnant. The role of this supernova to the scientific understanding of supernova remnants was crucial, as no other historical supernova created a pulsar whose precise age is known for certain. The only possible exception to this rule would be SN 1181, whose supposed remnant 3C 58 is home to a pulsar, but its identification using Chinese observations from 1181 is contested.The inner part of the Crab Nebula is dominated by a pulsar wind nebula enveloping the pulsar. Some sources consider the Crab Nebula to be an example of both a pulsar wind nebula as well as a supernova remnant, while others separate the two phenomena based on the different sources of energy production and behaviour.\\n\\n\\n=== Source of ultra-high-energy gamma rays ===\\nIn 2019 the Crab Nebula was observed to emit gamma rays in excess of 100 TeV, making it the first identified source beyond 100 TeV.\\n\\n\\n== Physical parameters ==\\n\\nIn visible light, the Crab Nebula consists of a broadly oval-shaped mass of filaments, about 6 arcminutes long and 4 arcminutes wide (by comparison, the full moon is 30 arcminutes across) surrounding a diffuse blue central region. In three dimensions, the nebula is thought to be shaped either like an oblate spheroid (estimated as 1,380 pc/4,500 ly away) or a prolate spheroid (estimated as 2,020 pc/6,600 ly away). The filaments are the remnants of the progenitor star\\'s atmosphere, and consist largely of ionised helium and hydrogen, along with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, neon and sulfur. The filaments\\' temperatures are typically between 11,000 and 18,000 K, and their densities are about 1,300 particles per cm3.In 1953, Iosif Shklovsky proposed that the diffuse blue region is predominantly produced by synchrotron radiation, which is radiation given off by the curving motion of electrons in a magnetic field. The radiation corresponded to electrons moving at speeds up to half the speed of light. Three years later the theory was confirmed by observations. In the 1960s it was found that the source of the curved paths of the electrons was the strong magnetic field produced by a neutron star at the centre of the nebula.\\n\\n\\n=== Distance ===\\nEven though the Crab Nebula is the focus of much attention among astronomers, its distance remains an open question, owing to uncertainties in every method used to estimate its distance. In 2008, the consensus was that its distance from Earth is 2.0 ± 0.5 kpc (6,500 ± 1,600 ly). Along its longest visible dimension, it thus measures about 4.1 ± 1 pc (13 ± 3 ly) across.The Crab Nebula currently is expanding outward at about 1,500 km/s (930 mi/s). Images taken several years apart reveal the slow expansion of the nebula, and by comparing this angular expansion with its spectroscopically determined expansion velocity, the nebula\\'s distance can be estimated. In 1973, an analysis of many methods used to compute the distance to the nebula had reached a conclusion of about 1.9 kpc (6,300 ly), consistent with the currently cited value.The Crab Pulsar itself was discovered in 1968 by Dr Susan Jocelyn Bell. Tracing back its expansion (assuming a constant decrease of expansion speed due to the nebula\\'s mass) yielded a date for the creation of the nebula several decades after 1054, implying that its outward velocity has decelerated less than assumed since the supernova explosion. This reduced deceleration is believed to be caused by energy from the pulsar that feeds into the nebula\\'s magnetic field, which expands and forces the nebula\\'s filaments outward.\\n\\n\\n=== Mass ===\\nEstimates of the total mass of the nebula are important for estimating the mass of the supernova\\'s progenitor star. The amount of matter contained in the Crab Nebula\\'s filaments (ejecta mass of ionized and neutral gas; mostly helium) is estimated to be 4.6±1.8 M☉.\\n\\n\\n=== Helium-rich torus ===\\nOne of the many nebular components (or anomalies) of the Crab Nebula is a helium-rich torus which is visible as an east–west band crossing the pulsar region. The torus composes about 25% of the visible ejecta. However, it is suggested by calculation that about 95% of the torus is helium. As yet, there has been no plausible explanation put forth for the structure of the torus.\\n\\n\\n== Central star ==\\n\\nAt the center of the Crab Nebula are two faint stars, one of which is the star responsible for the existence of the nebula. It was identified as such in 1942, when Rudolf Minkowski found that its optical spectrum was extremely unusual. The region around the star was found to be a strong source of radio waves in 1949 and X-rays in 1963, and was identified as one of the brightest objects in the sky in gamma rays in 1967. Then, in 1968, the star was found to be emitting its radiation in rapid pulses, becoming one of the first pulsars to be discovered.Pulsars are sources of powerful electromagnetic radiation, emitted in short and extremely regular pulses many times a second. They were a great mystery when discovered in 1967, and the team who identified the first one considered the possibility that it could be a signal from an advanced civilization. However, the discovery of a pulsating radio source in the centre of the Crab Nebula was strong evidence that pulsars were formed by supernova explosions. They now are understood to be rapidly rotating neutron stars, whose powerful magnetic field concentrates their radiation emissions into narrow beams.The Crab Pulsar is believed to be about 28–30 km (17–19 mi) in diameter; it emits pulses of radiation every 33 milliseconds. Pulses are emitted at wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. Like all isolated pulsars, its period is slowing very gradually. Occasionally, its rotational period shows sharp changes, known as \\'glitches\\', which are believed to be caused by a sudden realignment inside the neutron star. The energy released as the pulsar slows down is enormous, and it powers the emission of the synchrotron radiation of the Crab Nebula, which has a total luminosity about 75,000 times greater than that of the Sun.The pulsar\\'s extreme energy output creates an unusually dynamic region at the centre of the Crab Nebula. While most astronomical objects evolve so slowly that changes are visible only over timescales of many years, the inner parts of the Crab Nebula show changes over timescales of only a few days. The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar\\'s equatorial wind slams into the bulk of the nebula, forming a shock front. The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar to well out into the main body of the nebula.\\n\\n\\n== Progenitor star ==\\n\\nThe star that exploded as a supernova is referred to as the supernova\\'s progenitor star. Two types of stars explode as supernovae: white dwarfs and massive stars. In the so-called Type Ia supernovae, gases falling onto a \\'dead\\' white dwarf raise its mass until it nears a critical level, the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in a runaway nuclear fusion explosion that obliterates the star; in Type Ib/c and Type II supernovae, the progenitor star is a massive star whose core runs out of fuel to power its nuclear fusion reactions and collapses in on itself, releasing gravitational potential energy in a form that blows away the star\\'s outer layers. Type Ia supernovae do not produce pulsars, so the pulsar in the Crab Nebula shows it must have formed in a core-collapse supernova.Theoretical models of supernova explosions suggest that the star that exploded to produce the Crab Nebula must have had a mass of between 9 and 11 M☉. Stars with masses lower than 8 M☉ are thought to be too small to produce supernova explosions, and end their lives by producing a planetary nebula instead, while a star heavier than 12 M☉ would have produced a nebula with a different chemical composition from that observed in the Crab Nebula. Recent studies, however, suggest the progenitor could have been a super-asymptotic giant branch star in the 8 to 10 M☉ range that would have exploded in an electron-capture supernova. In June 2021 a paper in the journal Nature Astronomy reported that the 2018 supernova SN 2018zd (in the galaxy NGC 2146, about 31 million light-years from Earth) appeared to be the first observation of an electron-capture supernova The 1054 supernova explosion that created the Crab Nebula had been thought to be the best candidate for an electron-capture supernova, and the 2021 paper makes it more likely that this was correct.A significant problem in studies of the Crab Nebula is that the combined mass of the nebula and the pulsar add up to considerably less than the predicted mass of the progenitor star, and the question of where the \\'missing mass\\' is, remains unresolved. Estimates of the mass of the nebula are made by measuring the total amount of light emitted, and calculating the mass required, given the measured temperature and density of the nebula. Estimates range from about 1–5 M☉, with 2–3 M☉ being the generally accepted value. The neutron star mass is estimated to be between 1.4 and 2 M☉.\\nThe predominant theory to account for the missing mass of the Crab Nebula is that a substantial proportion of the mass of the progenitor was carried away before the supernova explosion in a fast stellar wind, a phenomenon commonly seen in Wolf–Rayet stars. However, this would have created a shell around the nebula. Although attempts have been made at several wavelengths to observe a shell, none has yet been found.\\n\\n\\n== Transits by Solar System bodies ==\\n\\nThe Crab Nebula lies roughly 1.5 degrees away from the ecliptic—the plane of Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun. This means that the Moon—and occasionally, planets—can transit or occult the nebula. Although the Sun does not transit the nebula, its corona passes in front of it. These transits and occultations can be used to analyse both the nebula and the object passing in front of it, by observing how radiation from the nebula is altered by the transiting body.\\n\\n\\n=== Lunar ===\\nLunar transits have been used to map X-ray emissions from the nebula. Before the launch of X-ray-observing satellites, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, X-ray observations generally had quite low angular resolution, but when the Moon passes in front of the nebula, its position is very accurately known, and so the variations in the nebula\\'s brightness can be used to create maps of X-ray emission. When X-rays were first observed from the Crab Nebula, a lunar occultation was used to determine the exact location of their source.\\n\\n\\n=== Solar ===\\nThe Sun\\'s corona passes in front of the Crab Nebula every June. Variations in the radio waves received from the Crab Nebula at this time can be used to infer details about the corona\\'s density and structure. Early observations established that the corona extended out to much greater distances than had previously been thought; later observations found that the corona contained substantial density variations.\\n\\n\\n=== Other objects ===\\nVery rarely, Saturn transits the Crab Nebula. Its transit on 4 January 2003 (UTC) was the first since 31 December 1295 (O.S.); another will not occur until 5 August 2267. Researchers used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to observe Saturn\\'s moon Titan as it crossed the nebula, and found that Titan\\'s X-ray \\'shadow\\' was larger than its solid surface, due to absorption of X-rays in its atmosphere. These observations showed that the thickness of Titan\\'s atmosphere is 880 km (550 mi). The transit of Saturn itself could not be observed, because Chandra was passing through the Van Allen belts at the time.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nLists of nebulae\\nSouthern Crab Nebula, so named for its resemblance to the Crab Nebula, but visible from the southern hemisphere\\nGalactic anticenter\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nCrab Nebula on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images\\nCrab Nebula in the University of Cambridge Catalogue of Galactic Supernova Remnants\\nCrab Nebula in the SEDS Messier index\\nCrab Nebula in the Chandra X-ray Observatory Field Guide series\\nCrab Nebula images by the Hubble Space Telescope\\nAnimation of expansion from 2008-2017 by Detlef Hartmann\\n'], ['Messier_85', 'Astronomical_objects', 'The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The common name comes from William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1842 using a 36-inch (91 cm) telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. The nebula was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731, and it corresponds with a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified that corresponds with a historical supernova explosion.\\nAt an apparent magnitude of 8.4, comparable to that of Saturn\\'s moon Titan, it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using binoculars under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of about 2.0 kiloparsecs (6,500 ly) from Earth. It has a diameter of 3.4 parsecs (11 ly), corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7 arcminutes, and is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometres per second (930 mi/s), or 0.5% of the speed of light.\\nAt the center of the nebula lies the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 28–30 kilometres (17–19 mi) across with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second, which emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves. At X-ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV, the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent gamma-ray source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 TeV. The nebula\\'s radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun\\'s corona was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula\\'s radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn\\'s moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.\\n\\n\\n== Observational history ==\\n\\nModern understanding that the Crab Nebula was created by a supernova traces back to 1921, when Carl Otto Lampland announced he had seen changes in the nebula\\'s structure. This \\neventually led to the conclusion that the creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright SN 1054 supernova recorded by ancient astronomers in AD 1054.\\n\\n\\n=== First identification ===\\nThe Crab Nebula was first identified in 1731 by John Bevis. The nebula was independently rediscovered in 1758 by Charles Messier as he was observing a bright comet. Messier catalogued it as the first entry in his catalogue of comet-like objects; in 1757, Alexis Clairaut reexamined the calculations of Edmund Halley and predicted the return of Halley\\'s Comet in late 1758. The exact time of the comet\\'s return required the consideration of perturbations to its orbit caused by planets in the Solar System such as Jupiter, which Clairaut and his two colleagues Jérôme Lalande and Nicole-Reine Lepaute carried out more precisely than Halley, finding that the comet should appear in the constellation of Taurus. It was in searching in vain for the comet that Charles Messier found the Crab Nebula, which he at first thought to be Halley\\'s comet. After some observation, noticing that the object that he was observing was not moving across the sky, Messier concluded that the object was not a comet. Messier then realised the usefulness of compiling a catalogue of celestial objects of a cloudy nature, but fixed in the sky, to avoid incorrectly cataloguing them as comets. This realization led him to compile the \"Messier catalogue\".\\n\\nWilliam Herschel observed the Crab Nebula numerous times between 1783 and 1809, but it is not known whether he was aware of its existence in 1783, or if he discovered it independently of Messier and Bevis. After several observations, he concluded that it was composed of a group of stars. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse observed the nebula at Birr Castle in 1844 using a 36-inch (0.9 m) telescope, and referred to the object as the \"Crab Nebula\" because a drawing he made of it looked like a crab. He observed it again later, in 1848, using a 72-inch (1.8 m) telescope but could not confirm the supposed resemblance, but the name stuck nevertheless.\\n\\n\\n=== Connection to SN 1054 ===\\n\\nThe Crab Nebula was the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion. In the early twentieth century, the analysis of early photographs of the nebula taken several years apart revealed that it was expanding. Tracing the expansion back revealed that the nebula must have become visible on Earth about 900 years before. Historical records revealed that a new star bright enough to be seen in the daytime had been recorded in the same part of the sky by Chinese astronomers on 4 July 1054, and probably also by Japanese observers.In 1913, when Vesto Slipher registered his spectroscopy study of the sky, the Crab Nebula was again one of the first objects to be studied. Changes in the cloud, suggesting its small extent, were discovered by Carl Lampland in 1921. That same year, John Charles Duncan demonstrated that the remnant is expanding, while Knut Lundmark noted its proximity to the guest star of 1054.In 1928, Edwin Hubble proposed associating the cloud with the star of 1054, an idea that remained controversial until the nature of supernovae was understood, and it was Nicholas Mayall who indicated that the star of 1054 was undoubtedly the supernova whose explosion produced the Crab Nebula. The search for historical supernovae started at that moment: seven other historical sightings have been found by comparing modern observations of supernova remnants with astronomical documents of past centuries. \\nAfter the original connection to Chinese observations, in 1934 connections were made to a 13th-century Japanese reference to a \"guest star\" in Meigetsuki a few weeks before the Chinese reference. The event was long considered unrecorded in Islamic astronomy, but in 1978 a reference was found in a 13th-century copy made by Ibn Abi Usaibia of a work by Ibn Butlan, a Nestorian Christian physician active in Baghdad at the time of the supernova.Given its great distance, the daytime \"guest star\" observed by the Chinese could only have been a supernova—a massive, exploding star, having exhausted its supply of energy from nuclear fusion and collapsed in on itself. Recent analysis of historical records have found that the supernova that created the Crab Nebula probably appeared in April or early May, rising to its maximum brightness of between apparent magnitude −7 and −4.5 (brighter even than Venus\\' −4.2 and everything in the night sky except the Moon) by July. The supernova was visible to the naked eye for about two years after its first observation.\\n\\n\\n=== Crab Pulsar ===\\n\\nIn the 1960s, because of the prediction and discovery of pulsars, the Crab Nebula again became a major center of interest. It was then that Franco Pacini predicted the existence of the Crab Pulsar for the first time, which would explain the brightness of the cloud. The star was observed shortly afterwards in 1968. The discovery of the Crab Pulsar, and the knowledge of its exact age (almost to the day) allows for the verification of basic physical properties of these objects, such as characteristic age and spin-down luminosity, the orders of magnitude involved (notably the strength of the magnetic field), along with various aspects related to the dynamics of the remnant. The role of this supernova to the scientific understanding of supernova remnants was crucial, as no other historical supernova created a pulsar whose precise age is known for certain. The only possible exception to this rule would be SN 1181, whose supposed remnant 3C 58 is home to a pulsar, but its identification using Chinese observations from 1181 is contested.The inner part of the Crab Nebula is dominated by a pulsar wind nebula enveloping the pulsar. Some sources consider the Crab Nebula to be an example of both a pulsar wind nebula as well as a supernova remnant, while others separate the two phenomena based on the different sources of energy production and behaviour.\\n\\n\\n=== Source of ultra-high-energy gamma rays ===\\nIn 2019 the Crab Nebula was observed to emit gamma rays in excess of 100 TeV, making it the first identified source beyond 100 TeV.\\n\\n\\n== Physical parameters ==\\n\\nIn visible light, the Crab Nebula consists of a broadly oval-shaped mass of filaments, about 6 arcminutes long and 4 arcminutes wide (by comparison, the full moon is 30 arcminutes across) surrounding a diffuse blue central region. In three dimensions, the nebula is thought to be shaped either like an oblate spheroid (estimated as 1,380 pc/4,500 ly away) or a prolate spheroid (estimated as 2,020 pc/6,600 ly away). The filaments are the remnants of the progenitor star\\'s atmosphere, and consist largely of ionised helium and hydrogen, along with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, neon and sulfur. The filaments\\' temperatures are typically between 11,000 and 18,000 K, and their densities are about 1,300 particles per cm3.In 1953, Iosif Shklovsky proposed that the diffuse blue region is predominantly produced by synchrotron radiation, which is radiation given off by the curving motion of electrons in a magnetic field. The radiation corresponded to electrons moving at speeds up to half the speed of light. Three years later the theory was confirmed by observations. In the 1960s it was found that the source of the curved paths of the electrons was the strong magnetic field produced by a neutron star at the centre of the nebula.\\n\\n\\n=== Distance ===\\nEven though the Crab Nebula is the focus of much attention among astronomers, its distance remains an open question, owing to uncertainties in every method used to estimate its distance. In 2008, the consensus was that its distance from Earth is 2.0 ± 0.5 kpc (6,500 ± 1,600 ly). Along its longest visible dimension, it thus measures about 4.1 ± 1 pc (13 ± 3 ly) across.The Crab Nebula currently is expanding outward at about 1,500 km/s (930 mi/s). Images taken several years apart reveal the slow expansion of the nebula, and by comparing this angular expansion with its spectroscopically determined expansion velocity, the nebula\\'s distance can be estimated. In 1973, an analysis of many methods used to compute the distance to the nebula had reached a conclusion of about 1.9 kpc (6,300 ly), consistent with the currently cited value.The Crab Pulsar itself was discovered in 1968 by Dr Susan Jocelyn Bell. Tracing back its expansion (assuming a constant decrease of expansion speed due to the nebula\\'s mass) yielded a date for the creation of the nebula several decades after 1054, implying that its outward velocity has decelerated less than assumed since the supernova explosion. This reduced deceleration is believed to be caused by energy from the pulsar that feeds into the nebula\\'s magnetic field, which expands and forces the nebula\\'s filaments outward.\\n\\n\\n=== Mass ===\\nEstimates of the total mass of the nebula are important for estimating the mass of the supernova\\'s progenitor star. The amount of matter contained in the Crab Nebula\\'s filaments (ejecta mass of ionized and neutral gas; mostly helium) is estimated to be 4.6±1.8 M☉.\\n\\n\\n=== Helium-rich torus ===\\nOne of the many nebular components (or anomalies) of the Crab Nebula is a helium-rich torus which is visible as an east–west band crossing the pulsar region. The torus composes about 25% of the visible ejecta. However, it is suggested by calculation that about 95% of the torus is helium. As yet, there has been no plausible explanation put forth for the structure of the torus.\\n\\n\\n== Central star ==\\n\\nAt the center of the Crab Nebula are two faint stars, one of which is the star responsible for the existence of the nebula. It was identified as such in 1942, when Rudolf Minkowski found that its optical spectrum was extremely unusual. The region around the star was found to be a strong source of radio waves in 1949 and X-rays in 1963, and was identified as one of the brightest objects in the sky in gamma rays in 1967. Then, in 1968, the star was found to be emitting its radiation in rapid pulses, becoming one of the first pulsars to be discovered.Pulsars are sources of powerful electromagnetic radiation, emitted in short and extremely regular pulses many times a second. They were a great mystery when discovered in 1967, and the team who identified the first one considered the possibility that it could be a signal from an advanced civilization. However, the discovery of a pulsating radio source in the centre of the Crab Nebula was strong evidence that pulsars were formed by supernova explosions. They now are understood to be rapidly rotating neutron stars, whose powerful magnetic field concentrates their radiation emissions into narrow beams.The Crab Pulsar is believed to be about 28–30 km (17–19 mi) in diameter; it emits pulses of radiation every 33 milliseconds. Pulses are emitted at wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. Like all isolated pulsars, its period is slowing very gradually. Occasionally, its rotational period shows sharp changes, known as \\'glitches\\', which are believed to be caused by a sudden realignment inside the neutron star. The energy released as the pulsar slows down is enormous, and it powers the emission of the synchrotron radiation of the Crab Nebula, which has a total luminosity about 75,000 times greater than that of the Sun.The pulsar\\'s extreme energy output creates an unusually dynamic region at the centre of the Crab Nebula. While most astronomical objects evolve so slowly that changes are visible only over timescales of many years, the inner parts of the Crab Nebula show changes over timescales of only a few days. The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar\\'s equatorial wind slams into the bulk of the nebula, forming a shock front. The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar to well out into the main body of the nebula.\\n\\n\\n== Progenitor star ==\\n\\nThe star that exploded as a supernova is referred to as the supernova\\'s progenitor star. Two types of stars explode as supernovae: white dwarfs and massive stars. In the so-called Type Ia supernovae, gases falling onto a \\'dead\\' white dwarf raise its mass until it nears a critical level, the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in a runaway nuclear fusion explosion that obliterates the star; in Type Ib/c and Type II supernovae, the progenitor star is a massive star whose core runs out of fuel to power its nuclear fusion reactions and collapses in on itself, releasing gravitational potential energy in a form that blows away the star\\'s outer layers. Type Ia supernovae do not produce pulsars, so the pulsar in the Crab Nebula shows it must have formed in a core-collapse supernova.Theoretical models of supernova explosions suggest that the star that exploded to produce the Crab Nebula must have had a mass of between 9 and 11 M☉. Stars with masses lower than 8 M☉ are thought to be too small to produce supernova explosions, and end their lives by producing a planetary nebula instead, while a star heavier than 12 M☉ would have produced a nebula with a different chemical composition from that observed in the Crab Nebula. Recent studies, however, suggest the progenitor could have been a super-asymptotic giant branch star in the 8 to 10 M☉ range that would have exploded in an electron-capture supernova. In June 2021 a paper in the journal Nature Astronomy reported that the 2018 supernova SN 2018zd (in the galaxy NGC 2146, about 31 million light-years from Earth) appeared to be the first observation of an electron-capture supernova The 1054 supernova explosion that created the Crab Nebula had been thought to be the best candidate for an electron-capture supernova, and the 2021 paper makes it more likely that this was correct.A significant problem in studies of the Crab Nebula is that the combined mass of the nebula and the pulsar add up to considerably less than the predicted mass of the progenitor star, and the question of where the \\'missing mass\\' is, remains unresolved. Estimates of the mass of the nebula are made by measuring the total amount of light emitted, and calculating the mass required, given the measured temperature and density of the nebula. Estimates range from about 1–5 M☉, with 2–3 M☉ being the generally accepted value. The neutron star mass is estimated to be between 1.4 and 2 M☉.\\nThe predominant theory to account for the missing mass of the Crab Nebula is that a substantial proportion of the mass of the progenitor was carried away before the supernova explosion in a fast stellar wind, a phenomenon commonly seen in Wolf–Rayet stars. However, this would have created a shell around the nebula. Although attempts have been made at several wavelengths to observe a shell, none has yet been found.\\n\\n\\n== Transits by Solar System bodies ==\\n\\nThe Crab Nebula lies roughly 1.5 degrees away from the ecliptic—the plane of Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun. This means that the Moon—and occasionally, planets—can transit or occult the nebula. Although the Sun does not transit the nebula, its corona passes in front of it. These transits and occultations can be used to analyse both the nebula and the object passing in front of it, by observing how radiation from the nebula is altered by the transiting body.\\n\\n\\n=== Lunar ===\\nLunar transits have been used to map X-ray emissions from the nebula.

Minerals that are rich in kaolinite are known as china clay or kaolin, traditionally used in the manufacture of porcelain. The particle size of metakaolin is smaller than cement particles, but not as fine as silica fume.\\n\\n\\n== Kaolinite sources ==\\nThe quality and reactivity of metakaolin is strongly dependent of the characteristics of the raw material used. Metakaolin can be produced from a variety of primary and secondary sources containing kaolinite:\\n\\nHigh purity kaolin deposits\\nKaolinite deposits or tropical soils of lower purity\\nPaper sludge waste (if containing kaolinite)\\nOil sand tailings (if containing kaolinite)\\n\\n\\n== Forming metakaolin ==\\nThe T-O clay mineral kaolinite does not contain interlayer cations or interlayer water. The temperature of dehydroxylation depends on the structural layer stacking order. Disordered kaolinite dehydroxylates between 530 and 570 °C, ordered kaolinite between 570 and 630 °C. Dehydroxylated disordered kaolinite shows higher pozzolanic activity than ordered. The dehydroxylation of kaolin to metakaolin is an endothermic process due to the large amount of energy required to remove the chemically bonded hydroxyl ions. Above the temperature range of dehydroxylation, kaolinite transforms into metakaolin, a complex amorphous structure which retains some long-range order due to layer stacking. Much of the aluminum of the octahedral layer becomes tetrahedrally and pentahedrally coordinated.\\nIn order to produce a pozzolan (supplementary cementitious material) nearly complete dehydroxylation must be reached without overheating, i.e., thoroughly roasted but not burnt. This produces an amorphous, highly pozzolanic state, whereas overheating can cause sintering, to form a dead burnt, nonreactive refractory, containing mullite and a defect Al-Si spinel. Reported optimum activation temperatures vary between 550 and 850 °C for varying durations, however the range 650-750 °C is most commonly quoted. \\nIn comparison with other clay minerals kaolinite shows a broad temperature interval between dehydroxylation and recrystallization, much favoring the formation of metakaolin and the use of thermally activated kaolin clays as pozzolans. Also, because the octahedral layer is directly exposed to the interlayer (in comparison to for instance T-O-T clay minerals such as smectites), structural disorder is attained more easily upon heating.\\n\\n\\n== High-reactivity metakaolin ==\\nHigh-reactivity metakaolin (HRM) is a highly processed reactive aluminosilicate pozzolan, a finely-divided material that reacts with slaked lime at ordinary temperature and in the presence of moisture to form a strong slow-hardening cement. It is formed by calcining purified kaolinite, generally between 650–700 °C in an externally fired rotary kiln. It is also reported that HRM is responsible for acceleration in the hydration of ordinary portland cement (OPC), and its major impact is seen within 24 hours. It also reduces the deterioration of concrete by Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR), particularly useful when using recycled crushed glass or glass fines as aggregate. The amount of slaked lime that can be bound by metakaolin is measured by the modified Chapelle test.\\n\\n\\n== Adsorption properties ==\\nThe adsorption surface properties of the metakaolins can be accomplished by inverse gas chromatography analysis.\\n\\n\\n== Concrete application ==\\nConsidered to have twice the reactivity of most other pozzolans, metakaolin is a valuable admixture for concrete/cement applications. Replacing portland cement with 8–20% (by weight) metakaolin produces a concrete mix that exhibits favorable engineering properties, including: the filler effect, the acceleration of OPC hydration, and the pozzolanic reaction. The filler effect is immediate, while the effect of pozzolanic reaction occurs between 3 and 14 days.\\n\\n\\n== Advantages ==\\nIncreased compressive and flexural strengths\\nReduced permeability (including chloride permeability)\\nReduced potential for efflorescence, which occurs when calcium is transported by water to the surface where it combines with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make calcium carbonate, which precipitates on the surface as a white residue.\\nIncreased resistance to chemical attack\\nIncreased durability\\nReduced effects of alkali-silica reactivity (ASR)\\nEnhanced workability and finishing of concrete\\nReduced shrinkage, due to \"particle packing\" making concrete denser\\nImproved color by lightening the color of concrete making it possible to tint lighter integral color.\\n\\n\\n== Uses ==\\nHigh performance, high strength, and lightweight concrete\\nPrecast and poured-mold concrete\\nFibercement and ferrocement products\\nGlass fiber reinforced concrete\\nCountertops, art sculptures (see for example the free-standing sculptures of Albert Vrana)\\nMortar and stucco\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nConcrete\\nEngineered Cementitious Composite\\nFly ash\\nKaolinite\\nPortland cement\\nPozzolan\\nRice husk ash (also very rich in SiO2)\\nSilica fume\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n'], ['Miguel_+üngel_Mart+¡n_Bordera', 'Artists', \"Spanish artist that was born in Alicante (Spain) on 24/09/1966.

Throughout the length and breadth of the whole Spanish geography and from the beginning of Miguel Angel artistic path it have been a numerous Spanish cities where they could have seen his spectacle, being the scenes the principal streets, avenues and squares of cities such as Madrid, Valencia, Alicante, Ibiza, Sabadell, Malaga, Salamanca, Vitoria, Segovia or Pontevedra, among others, where Miguel Angel has developed artistic projects for their festivities, events or The Three Kings Parade.\\n2014 was a very productive year for Miguel Angel Martin, thanks to the imagination and the effort in each show that he creates, Carros de Foc has been present all over the world realizing among others, a tour along the Arab Emirates and taken his shows to South Korea, China and Europe.\\nIn addition Miguel Angel Urban Theatre Company has been present in many Spanish cities, representing his shows in festivals, events and other acts like The Medieval Fair of Melilla, the XX Anniversary of the Spanish Cities Heritage of Humanity in Segovia, The “Crida” of Valencia & The 9 of October in Alicante.\\nThe year 2015 was full of opportunities, with very important performances that continued nourishing M.A.M experiences. The year started with the presentation of the new giant sculpture Euterpe on The Three Kings Parade in Madrid, followed by The Carnivals in Cadiz, Alicante & Saint Raphael ( France).\\nThe Urban Theatre released the new spectacle, “ The Box of the Magic Letters” in the act of closing of the Gala Importantes of “The Information” newspaper.\\n\\n\\n== The carácter of his Works ==\\nThe Giant Mobile Sculptures that appear in the street theatre works of Miguel Angel Martin Bordera, are original creations, of big dimensions. Due to their realism, they seem to be alive. They are articulated and mobility gifted reaching 12m of height. Their realistic character makes them surprising and they represent animals like a horse, an eagle or fantastic characters. The scenography where his creations are performed are own made and they are put to the service of the work so that the visual experience is complete. The characterization of the characters, the costumes, the body make-up, that includes latex worked, are combined for adding to the different artistic disciplines that integrates the performances a fantastic emotional and expressive strength.\\n\\n\\n== Latest creations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Natural Spirit ===\\nNatural Spirit in his great version, is one of the master pieces where the giant sculptures of Carros de Foc, Royal Horse, Eagle Sophia and the biggest puppet in the world named Salvador with 38 inches height. These three sculptures are the conductive trio that introduces us into the show to put in value the concept of Natural Spirit. The aim is to make us reflect on the aggression of mankind towards the nature, the need to reach a well-deserved respect towards the environment. The intention is to form a balance that bring sustainability between man and nature. Many ways are used to express and demonstrate this: music, lights, high flying acrobatics using fabrics, rhythmic dancers using fire, acrobats, interpretation and video. Different formats merge with different scenes each representing one of the earth's element; fire, air and water, interacting at the same time with the giant sculptures of “ Salvador”, “ Águila Sophía” or “Caballo Real”. This is undoubtedly a show of great visual impact, that it does not stop surprising where ever it goes in the world like in Spain, France, Portugal, Morocco, Romania, Italy....\\n\\n\\n=== La Crida, Valencia ===\\n\\n\\n=== The Magic Box of Letters ===\\nThe play is to reflect the basic values of the humanity. The protagonist is a young girl named Euterpe, created with the purpose of talking about the forgotten values, seeing beyond and touching upon the internal lethargic feelings of humanity.\\nThe show is divided into three parts. The first part is the presentation of Euterpe, where she describes her human and industrial condition.  At the same time of Euterpe presentation, a creation of a vertical choreography symbolizes the great risk that is to live in today's modern society.\\nThe second part, Euterpe makes a tribute to the father figure as a creator and by extension to all the creators. The father figure is symbolize through the character that performs an acrobatic mid air spectacular. . Through  this six meter high aerial acrobatic choreography, the staging is done. What it will mean for the creator to be side by side with his daughter to support her unconditionally through her  life.\\nIn the scene with which the stage play ends there is a reflection about the strength of the letters that creates words and how to use them properly, depending how they are being pronounced.\\nEuterpe invites us to continuously use kind words that open doors. This scene is performed with the elevation of the puppet levitating into the air above the square, creating a sublime visual scene.\\nDuring this scene four vertical dancers perched on the side stairs and stage space, to visually enhance this scene, symbolizing the industrial humanization.\\nAny good spectacle goes behind hours of essay and this one is a clear example. A metal framework was created as a performance area, in this stage play for the vertical choreography, posing new challenges in the artwork design by Miguel Ángel Martín the company artistic director. This choreography was a novelty among Carros de Foc. It showed the innovation and complexity necessary, meaning, many extra hours of work and rehearsals to accomplish the desired results needed to create the magic\\n\\n\\n== References in TV ==\\nMiguel Ángel Martín en Canal 9 \\nMiguel Ángel Martín en TV1  \\nMiguel Ángel Martín en TVN Chile  \\nMiguel Ángel Martín en Antena 3 \\nMiguel Ángel Martín en Directo.

It is one of the most famous works by the neo-classical Italian sculptor Giulio Monteverde (1837-1917) and was commissioned by Francesco Oneto, a president of the Banca Generale, in honour of deceased members of his family.\\nPortraying a pensive angel with long, richly detailed wings, it is acknowledged as one of the most beautiful and sensual sculptures in its genre, to which Monteverde contributed other important neo-classical works.\\nA picture of the work graces the cover of the publication, Camposanto Di Genova.  The booklet calls the work, \"a true masterpiece\" and states, \"The Angel, who guards the urn, is admired for the perfect moulding of the arms, neck and head, the deep and soft expression of grief which appears on her features; she holds a trumpet in her right hand, as if ready to sound it on the last judgement day.\"\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nF.Resasco, La Necropoli di Staglieno, Genova 1892\\nT.Crombie, The Sculptors of Staglieno, Genoese nineteenth-century funerary monuments, in Apollo 1973 n. 135\\nR.Bossaglia-M.F.Giubilei, Cadaveri eccellenti, in Arte 1982, n. 124\\nF.Sborgi (a cura di), L\\'Ottocento e il Novecento.

It is an alternative to other contemporary Western burial methods and funerary customs.\\nThe body may be prepared without chemical preservatives or disinfectants such as embalming fluid, which might destroy the microbial decomposers that break the body down. It may be buried in a biodegradable coffin, casket, or shroud. The grave does not use a burial vault or outer burial container that would prevent the body\\'s contact with soil. The grave should be shallow enough to allow microbial activity similar to that found in composting. Natural burials can take place both on private land (subject to regulations) and in any cemetery that will accommodate the vault-free technique.While all natural burials seek to prevent environmental damage done by conventional techniques, some go a step further by using burial fees to acquire land to restore native habitat and save endangered species. Such land management techniques are called \"conservation burials\".  In addition to restoration ecology, and habitat conservation projects, others have proposed alternative natural uses of the land such as sustainable agriculture and permaculture, to maintain the burial area in perpetuity. Landscaping methods may accelerate or slow down the decomposition rate of bodies, depending on the soil system. Natural burials also do not use any machinery or heavy equipment for digging the grave site. Instead, the grave sites are dug by hand.The first official conservation burial was established in the United States; however, natural burial grounds have been used previously in UK and the practice matches the methods used in many ancient and indigenous cultures.\\n\\n\\n== Environmental issues with conventional burial ==\\nEach year, 22,500 cemeteries across the United States bury approximately:\\n30 million board feet (70,000 m3) of hardwood caskets\\n90,272 tons of steel caskets\\n14,000 tons of steel vaults\\n2,700 tons of copper and bronze caskets\\n1,636,000 tons of reinforced concrete vaults\\n827,060 US gallons (3,130 m3) of embalming fluid, which usually includes formaldehyde.When formaldehyde is used for embalming, it breaks down, and the chemicals released into the ground after burial and ensuing decomposition are inert. The problems with the use of formaldehyde and its constituent components in natural burial are the exposure of mortuary workers to it and the killing of the decomposer microbes necessary for breakdown of the body in the soil. Natural burial promotes the restoration of poor soil areas and allows for long-term reuse of the land.Coffins (tapered-shoulder shape) and caskets (rectangular) are made from a variety of materials, most of them not biodegradable. 80–85% of the caskets sold for burial in North America in 2006 were of stamped steel. Solid wood and particle board (chipboard) coffins with hardwood veneers account for 10–15% of sales, and fiberglass and alternative materials such as woven fiber make up the rest. In Australia 85–90% of coffins are solid wood and particle board. Most traditional caskets in the UK are made from chipboard covered in a thin veneer. Handles are usually plastic designed to look like brass. Chipboard requires glue to stick the wood particles together. Some glues that are used, such as those that contain formaldehyde, are feared to cause pollution when they are burned during cremation or when degrading in the ground. However, not all engineered wood products are produced using formaldehyde glues. Caskets and coffins are often manufactured using exotic and even endangered species of wood, and are designed to prevent decomposition. While there are generally no restrictions on the type of coffin used, most sites encourage the use of environmentally friendly coffins made from materials like cane, bamboo, wicker or fiberboard. A weight bearing shroud is another option.\\n\\n\\n== Memorialization ==\\nNatural burial grounds employ a variety of methods of memorialization. Families that bury their loved ones in nature preserves can record the GPS coordinates of the location where they are buried, without using physical markers. Some natural burial sites use flat wooden plaques, or a name written on a natural rock. Many families plant trees, or other native plants near the grave to provide a living memorial.\\n\\n\\n== Alternative methods of burial ==\\nAlternatives to ground burials include burial in a coral reef, sky burial, burial at sea and hybrid cemeteries.\\n\\n\\n=== Coral reefs ===\\nCremated remains are sometimes placed inside concrete coral reef balls, and ceremoniously placed in the sea as part of a reef ecosystem. These balls are used to repair damage to coral reefs, and to provide new habitat for fish and other sea life.\\n\\n\\n=== Sky burial ===\\n\\nIn some parts of Tibet and Mongolia, a person\\'s remains are fed to vultures in a burial known as sky burial. This is seen as being good to the environment as well as good karma in Buddhism.\\n\\n\\n=== Burial at sea ===\\n\\nBurial at sea is seen as a natural burial if done in a way that benefits the environment, and without formaldehyde. Some organizations specialize in natural burial at sea (in a shroud), allowing the body to decompose or be consumed by animals. The EPA has instated a general permit of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) has authorized the burial of non cremated human remains at sea. Human remains can be buried at sea as an alternate form of a natural burial. Under certain guidelines as per The United States Coast Guard and The United States Navy.\\n\\n\\n=== Hybrid ===\\nA hybrid cemetery is a conventional cemetery that offers the essential aspects of natural burial, either throughout the cemetery or in a designated section. Hybrid cemeteries can earn a certification that does not require them to use vaults. This allows for the use of any eco-friendly, biodegradable burial container such as a shroud or a soft wood casket.\\n\\n\\n== Locations ==\\nNatural burial has been practiced for thousands of years, but has been interrupted in modern times by new methods such as vaults, liners, embalming, and mausoleums that mitigate the decomposition process. In the late 19th century Sir Francis Seymour Hayden proposed \"earth to earth burial\" in a pamphlet of the same name, as an alternative to both cremation and the slow putrefaction of encased corpses.\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\nThe Association of Natural Burial Grounds (ANBG) was established by The Natural Death Centre charity in 1994. It aims to help people to establish sites, to provide guidance to natural burial ground operators, to represent its members, and to provide a Code of Conduct for members. The NDC also publishes The Natural Death Handbook.The first woodland burial ground in the UK was created in 1993 at Carlisle Cemetery and is called The Woodland Burial. Nearly 300 dedicated natural burial grounds have been created in the UK.\\n\\n\\n=== Canada ===\\nEach province and territory within Canada has its own resources and regulations for handling death and the disposal of the body. In British Columbia, green burials are treated the same way as traditional burials, as embalming is not legally required for interment. All burials are required to follow the regulations set forth by their respective provincial government.With growing interest in promoting eco-friendly practices, natural burials have been discussed in various Canadian news outlets. Some debate still exists around what makes certain funeral practices eco-friendly and how cemeteries justify these claims as no government-imposed standard or definition currently exist.\\nEco-friendly funeral practices in Canada can include:\\n\\nBurial at sea\\nTree planting\\nGreen/natural burialsCanada offers a wide range of environmentally friendly services and alternatives to conventional funerary customs and corpse disposal practices in Canada. The Green Burial Council is an environmental certification organization for green burials practised in North America (Canada and the US). Environmental certificates are offered to cemeteries, funeral homes, and product manufacturers involved in the funeral industry. These certificates would allow consumers to distinguish between the three different levels of green burial grounds and their appropriate standards. The Green Burial Council also offers information on the types of coffins, urns, and embalming tools that would fall under the eco-friendly category and be available for North American consumers.\\nThe Green Burial Society of Canada was founded in 2013 with the goal to ensure standards of certification are set for green burial practices. The society emphasizes five principles of green burial: no embalming, direct earth burial, ecological restoration and conservation, communal memorialization, and the optimization of land use.The Natural Burial Association (NBA) is an independent, non-profit organization established in 2005 to promote natural burial in Canada and to encourage the establishment of natural burial sites. The organization lists the four current natural cemetery sites on their website located in: Victoria, British Columbia, Cobourg, Ontario, Brampton, Ontario, and Pickering, Ontario.\\n\\n\\n==== Royal Oak Burial Park ====\\nLocated in Victoria, British Columbia, the Royal Oak Burial Park opened the Woodlands grave site for green burial space in the cemetery since October 2008, dedicating its space to burials that allow for the natural decomposition of human remains which in turn provides nutrients for the surrounding ecosystem. The area has native Coastal Douglas Fir along with a variety of ecologically similar tree species, which the cemetery claims to keep as close to the natural ecosystem as possible. In order to be interred in Royal Oak Burial Park, embalming of the body is prohibited. The body must be kept in its natural state, which is then placed in some form of biodegradable container or shroud. Traditional grave markers are not used, but rather families are given options to engrave natural boulders or plants.\\n\\n\\n==== Union Cemetery ====\\nFound in Cobourg, Ontario, the Cobourg Union Cemetery is located on 20 acres of land, currently containing 3,800 burial lots. The cemetery is made up of both traditional burials with headstones and regular interment practices, as well as a green space dedicated to eco-friendly burials. Consumers are given information about biodegradable coffins and procedures for a green burial. Families are not allowed to place permanent markers on the grave sites other than native species of plants such as flowers and bushes.\\n\\n\\n==== Meadowvale Cemetery ====\\nThe Meadowvale Cemetery originally opened in 1981 in Brampton, Ontario, with the green burial section of the cemetery opening in 2012. The cemetery allows for both burial and cremation as long as embalming is done without formaldehyde or other harsh chemicals. They also ensure that remains are placed into a non-toxic, biodegradable container. Graves are not allowed to be marked with traditional headstones, but they offer a granite stone at the site\\'s entrance for name engraving.\\n\\n\\n==== Duffin Meadows Cemetery ====\\nDuffin Meadows Cemetery is located in Pickering, Ontario, and is attached to the original traditional cemetery. The cemetery offers natural burials for individuals who have been embalmed to eco-friendly standards, then interred using biodegradable shrouds and coffins. Grave sites will be left to grow over naturally, meaning grass will not be mowed and the placement of artificial flowers and other markers will not be allowed.\\n\\n\\n=== Australia ===\\nThere are a number of different natural burial parks across Australia, each of them slightly different in what they offer. One of the more advanced parks is Lake Macquarie Memorial Park, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, which contains a Natural Memorial reserve dedicated to natural burials.\\n\\n\\n=== New Zealand ===\\nNew Zealand\\'s Natural Burial organisation was started in 1999 by Mark Blackham. It is a not-for-profit organization that advocates for natural cemeteries, promotes the concept to the public, and certifies cemeteries, funeral directors and caskets for use in participating cemeteries.The first natural cemetery in New Zealand was established in 2008 in the capital, Wellington, as a partnership between the Wellington City Council and Natural Burials. It is the nation\\'s biggest natural cemetery, covering approx 2 hectares, and home to 120 burials (April 2015).\\nMore natural cemeteries have since been set up by between Natural Burials and the council authorities in New Plymouth in 2011, Ōtaki in 2012. and Marlborough in 2014.Other councils have set up small natural burial zones: Marsden Valley in 2011, Motueka in 2012, and Hamilton in 2014. Although these have all based on the approach used by Natural Burials, they have not been certified by the organisation.\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\nThe Green Burial Council (GBC) is an independent, tax-exempt, nonprofit organization that aims to encourage sustainability in the interment industry and to use burial as a means of ecological restoration and landscape conservation. Founded in 2005, the GBC has been stewarded by individuals representing the environmental/conservation community, consumer organizations, academia, the deathcare industry, and such organizations and institutions as The Nature Conservancy, The Trust for Public Land, AARP, and the University of Colorado. The organization established the nation\\'s first certifiable standards for cemeteries, funeral providers, burial product manufacturers, and cremation facilities. As of 2013, there are a total of 37 burial grounds certified by the GBC in 23 states and British Columbia. A cemetery becomes certified by demonstrating compliance with stringent established standards for a given category. Conventional funeral providers in 39 states now offer the burial package approved by the GBC.\\nCalifornia: Most of the 32-acre (130,000 m2) Fernwood Burial Ground, adjacent to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in Mill Valley, California, is set aside for natural burial, with no tombstones or caskets.\\nPurissima Cemetery is a natural burial cemetery located south of Half Moon Bay, California.\\nFlorida:\\nPrairie Creek Conservation Cemetery in Gainesville, Florida, was the state\\'s first conservation burial ground. The 93-acre preserve is protected in partnership with local nonprofit conservation organization, Alachua Conservation Trust. The space is actively managed and being restored to diverse prairie and hardwood forest.New Jersey: Steelmantown Cemetery is the only cemetery in the State of New Jersey certified and approved by the Green Burial Council as a Level 3 Natural Burial Ground.\\nOhio: Foxfield Preserve, adjacent to The Wilderness Center\\'s headquarters near Wilmot, Ohio, was the first nature preserve cemetery in the US to be operated by a nonprofit conservation organization. Naturalists from The Wilderness Center have restored this formerly agricultural land to native prairie grasses and wildflowers. A section has also been reforested in native hardwood trees.Kokosing Nature Preserve is a conservation burial ground located in Gambier, Ohio. A project of the Philander Chase Conservancy, Kenyon College\\'s land trust, the preserve offers a natural burial option on twenty-three acres of restored prairies and woodlands.Maine:Cedar Brook Burial Ground in Limington, Maine, the first green cemetery in Maine, is located on a 150-acre tree farm thirty miles due west of Portland. Within its borders sits the rock wall-enclosed Joshua Small Cemetery, a tiny, historic graveyard whose dozen burials date back to the early 1800s.Oregon: River View Cemetery, located in Portland, Oregon, is registered with the Green Burial Council as a \"hybrid\" natural burial cemetery.  Rather than restricting natural burials to just one specific section, River View permits natural burial in nearly every area of the cemetery, allowing those who wish to be interred in existing family plots without an outer burial container, without embalming, or even without a casket if they choose to do so.\\nPennsylvania:Penn Forest Natural Burial Park is the first Natural Burial Grounds in Pennsylvania certified by the Green Burial Council. Burial sites comprise 2.5 acres of the property.\\nSouth Carolina:Ramsey Creek Preserve is a green burial site which was established in South Carolina in 1998. This cemetery was opened to allow for burials where bodies are not embalmed or cremated, because of concern about the negative impacts that the chemicals and processes of these funeral preparation methods may have on the environment—which is why it is considered \"green\".Texas:Countryside Memorial Park located near Marion, Texas southeast of San Antonio is a natural, green burial park. All burials occur at a depth of approximately 3 to 3½ feet and have a 2–3 foot mound of earth above them. This depth ensures that the nutrient layer is raised to a higher soil stratum where microbes and oxygen can expedite the decomposition process. Each burial is covered by approximately 60 inches of soil and is undetectable to human or animal noses (with the exception of bears, which are not an issue in Texas). Countryside was incorporated as a cemetery in 1991 but several pioneers were buried on the property previously, the latest being interred in 1869. At 1 1/2 acres, thus far 300 plots have been surveyed. It is primarily a meadow, though there are some mature oak trees on the property, with plans for additional tree planting on designated plots. Cattle graze the park in season.Eloise Woods Community Natural Burial Park was established in 2010 and is located in a wooded preserve near Cedar Creek, Texas.  Burials are only permitted in areas that will not degrade the land.  Some areas of the preserve are \"off limits\" whereas other areas are suitable for cremated remains.  These decisions are based on what is best for the ecological restoration of the preserve. The total land for the preserve is less than 10 acres.Tennessee:\\nLarkspur Conservation is Tennessee\\'s first nature preserve for natural burial. Located just outside Nashville, this conservation burial ground protects 112 acres of rare mixed-mesophytic forest and prairie in partnership with The Nature Conservancy.Wisconsin:Circle Cemetery, located at Circle Sanctuary Nature Preserve in southwestern Wisconsin, has offered burial of cremated remains and non-embalmed bodies since 1995. It is operated by Circle Sanctuary, a Wiccan church.\\n\\n\\n== Religious practices ==\\nJewish law forbids embalming for traditional burials, which it considers to be desecration of the body. The body is ritually washed by select members of the Jewish community, wrapped in either a linen or muslin sheet, and placed in an all-wood casket. The casket must not have any metal in it, and it often has holes in the bottom to ensure that it and the cadaver rapidly decompose and return to the earth. Burial vaults are not used unless required by the cemetery. In Israel, Jews are buried without a casket, in just the shroud.Islamic law instructs that the deceased be washed and buried with only a wrapping of white cloth to preserve dignity. The cloth is sometimes perfumed, but as in natural burial, no chemical preservatives or embalming fluid are used, nor is there a burial vault, coffin or casket. There is no legal requirements for using a coffin in the UK and a body can be buried in a cloth if desired.\\n\\n\\n== In the media ==\\nToward the end of its final season in 2005, the HBO series Six Feet Under prominently featured natural burial.\\n2014 documentary A Will for the Woods explores natural burial, primarily through the lens of one terminally ill North Carolina man\\'s decision to have one.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCemetery\\nDisposal of human corpses\\nEnvironmentally friendly\\nFuneral\\nHindu burial\\nIslamic burial\\nJewish burial\\nPlastination\\nPromession\\nSky burial\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nThe Natural Death Centre Charity, UK, Association of Natural Burial Grounds Registered Charity No: 1091396  @ndccharity an educational charity which sees death as a natural part of life.

It is positioned around 3° to the north and slightly west of the star Gamma Comae Berenices and is visible in a small telescope. The galaxy was discovered by German-born astronomer William Herschel on March 13, 1785. It was labelled as peculiar by Allan Sandage in 1961 because of the unusual structure in the center of the bar. NGC 4314 is a member of the Coma I group of galaxies.The morphological classification of this galaxy is SBa, which indicates a barred spiral galaxy (SB) with very tightly wound spiral arms (a). It is inclined at an angle of 21° to the line of sight from the Earth, and the primary bar is oriented with a position angle of 158°.  The bar extends out to a diameter of 76″ before joining the spiral arms. These trail in 130° arcs out to a radius of 125″ from the nucleus. Outside the nuclear region, the galaxy is considered generally gas-poor, with no H II regions in the outer spiral arms.There is a prominent ring of star formation about the galactic nucleus with a radius of 9″. 76 open clusters of stars has been found associated with this ring, and these are probably due, at least in part, to Lindblad resonance. Most of these clusters are 15 million years old or less. The current burst of galactic star formation is estimated to have lasted 30 million years.

When Ali Pasha revolted against the Sublime Porte, Omer was his treasurer. He initially commanded the army tasked with defending the eastern approaches to Ioannina, but entered into an agreement with Ismail Pasha, the then commander-in-chief of the Sultan's forces, disbanding his army in exchange for the pashalik of Berat.After the death of Ali Pasha Omer was among the commanders who were sent by Hurşid Ahmed Pasha, the new commander-in-chief, to suppress the Greek Revolution which had broken out in March 1821. On 24 April 1821, he defeated the Greeks at the Battle of Alamana and had their commander, Athanasios Diakos, impaled. Vrioni's advance was temporarily halted by Odysseas Androutsos who, with a handful of men, inflicted heavy casualties upon him at the Battle of the inn of Gravia on 8 May 1821.\\n\\n\\n== Siege of Missolonghi ==\\n\\nIn late 1822, he and Mehmed Reshid Pasha joined forces to besiege the town of Missolonghi. The town was completely surrounded on 25 October, and might have fallen, had the locals left the city. However they resisted heroically and Vrioni resorted to negotiations in order to save his men, against the opinion of Mehmed Reshid and Yussuf Pasha. The besieged Greeks destroyed the morale of the Ottoman army and when they were reinforced by sea the novice Turkish captains and the two pashas scheduled their main assault for Christmas night, 24 December, calculating that the Greeks would be caught by surprise. However, the attack failed. Six days later, the siege was lifted.\\n\\n\\n== Later career ==\\nAs a result of this failure, the antagonism between Omer Vrioni and Mehmed Reshid escalated, resulting in his recall by the Porte in 1824, when he was assigned a command in Macedonia.

Though pasties are commonly associated with strippers, burlesque shows and erotic entertainment, they are also, at times, worn as an undergarment, beachwear, or as a form of protest during women\\'s rights events such as Go Topless Day that may avoid potential prosecution under indecency laws.\\n\\n\\n== Design ==\\n\\nPasties come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes, typically  not much larger than the areola. Pasties are usually applied with a special tape or glue fixative, often gum arabic.  However, in some situations keeping pasties from falling off can be an issue, as can be their removal. Some people are allergic to some adhesives or pastie material. Due to this, most high quality pasties are made of hypoallergenic silicone and use special adhesives to reduce the chances of an allergic reaction. Some pasties are for single-use, while others are washable and can be reused.\\nPasties are sometimes worn with a sideless bikini bottom such as a C-string held by an internal flexible frame. Alternatively a vulva cover, commonly known as a merkin pastie, can be attached with adhesive. These pasties for the genitalia are known as maebari in Japanese.\\n\\n\\n== Entertainment ==\\nPasties emerged in burlesque and striptease in the 1920s as a way to avoid breaking the law by performing topless or nude. Pasties came to be regarded by some as more aesthetic and erotic. They were worn in cabarets such as the  Folies Bergère and  Le Lido. Burlesque performer Carrie Finnell is attributed with adding tassels which hang from the center and incorporating tassel twirling as part of a performance.In parts of the United States, erotic dancers wear pasties in strip clubs to avoid prosecution under local public indecency laws. In extreme cases, liquid latex pasties are used to comply with local laws, raising criticism by strippers that lawmakers are engaging in cruelty by requiring use of adhesive material on the nipple. Such restrictions generally applied in Chicago until Chicago City Council changed the city\\'s liquor license statutes in 2020, removing references to gender. Women working in the city\\'s topless-only restaurants and strip clubs are no longer required to affix pasties or use other latex coverings on their breasts.Pasties are worn by many neo-burlesque performers and are also found in night clubs, fetish parties and parades, such as pride parades.\\nPasties were and may still be worn by some actresses while filming an otherwise apparently topless or nude scene, which is not caught by the camera angle.\\n\\n\\n== Underwear ==\\nSome who choose to go braless (often the most practical choice with a strapless or backless dress) may wear pasties, so that their nipples and areolae are not visible through sheer clothing or lingerie, or in case they experience a nipple erection. \\nSome people wear pasties to avoid fissure of the nipple (colloquially known as \"runner\\'s nipple\"), irritation caused by chafing by fabric such as a Tshirt.

His compositions for piano, written between the 1860s and the 1920s, include some of his best known works.\\nFauré\\'s major sets of piano works are thirteen nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed during several decades in his long career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F♯ major, Mazurka in B♭ major, Thème et variations in C♯ minor, and Huit pièces brèves.  For piano duet, Fauré composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.\\nMuch of Fauré\\'s piano music is difficult to play, but is rarely virtuosic in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and understatement.\\n\\n\\n== Introduction ==\\nAlthough for much of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly preferred the piano. He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, \"In piano music there\\'s no room for padding – one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It\\'s perhaps the most difficult genre of all.\" Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as \"Piano piece No. X\". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, \"the greater they are, the worse they play me.\" Even a virtuoso such as Franz Liszt said that he found Fauré\\'s music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, \"I\\'ve run out of fingers\".  Fauré\\'s years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using arpeggiated figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists. This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was ambidextrous, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns wrote to him in 1917, \"Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to get to the end of it by dint of absolute determination.\"As a man, Fauré was said to possess \"that mysterious gift that no other can replace or surpass: charm\", and charm is a conspicuous feature of many of his early compositions. His early piano works are influenced in style by Chopin, and throughout his life he composed piano works using similar titles to those of Chopin, notably nocturnes and barcarolles. An even greater influence was Schumann, whose piano music Fauré loved more than any other. The authors of The Record Guide (1955) wrote that Fauré learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, \"and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated.\" When Fauré was a student at the École Niedermeyer his tutor had introduced him to new concepts of harmony, no longer outlawing certain chords as \"dissonant\". By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Fauré anticipated the techniques of Impressionist composers.In later years Fauré\\'s music was written under the shadow of the composer\\'s increasing deafness, becoming gradually less charming and more austere, marked by what the composer Aaron Copland called \"intensity on a background of calm.\" The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the accessible earlier piano works, rather than the later music, which expresses \"such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation\" that listeners are left uneasy. The Fauré scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux writes:\\n\\nFauré\\'s stylistic evolution can ... be observed in his works for piano. The elegant and captivating first pieces, which made the composer famous, show the influence of Chopin, Saint-Saëns, and Liszt. The lyricism and complexity of his style in the 1890s are evident in the Nocturnes nos. 6 and 7, the Barcarolle no. 5 and the Thème et variations. Finally, the stripped-down style of the final period informs the last nocturnes (nos.10–13), the series of great barcarolles (nos. 8–11) and the astonishing Impromptu no. 5.\\n\\n\\n== Nocturnes ==\\n\\nThe nocturnes, along with the barcarolles, are generally regarded as the composer\\'s greatest piano works. Fauré greatly admired the music of Chopin, and was happy to compose in forms and patterns established by the earlier composer. Morrison notes that Fauré\\'s nocturnes follow Chopin\\'s model, contrasting serene outer sections with livelier or more turbulent central episodes. The composer\\'s son Philippe commented that the nocturnes \"are not necessarily based on rêveries or on emotions inspired by the night. They are lyrical, generally impassioned pieces, sometimes anguished or wholly elegiac.\"\\nNocturne No. 1 in E♭ minor, Op. 33/1 (c.1875)Nectoux rates the first nocturne as one of the best of the composer\\'s early works. It is dedicated, like Fauré\\'s song \"Après un rêve\", to his friend and early patron Marguerite Baugnies. Morrison calls the piece \"cloistered and elegiac.\" Though published as the composer\\'s Op. 33/1 in 1883, it was written considerably earlier. It opens with a slow, pensive melody, followed by a more agitated second theme and another melody in C major, and ends with the return of the opening theme. The pianist and academic Sally Pinkas writes that the work contains many hallmarks of Fauré\\'s style, including \"undulating rhythms, syncopation of the accompaniment against the melody and layered textures are already in evidence.\"\\nNocturne No. 2 in B major, Op. 33/2 (c.1880)The second nocturne opens with a bell-like passage, andantino espressivo, recalling – although Fauré said it was unconscious – the sound of distant bells that he heard frequently when a boy. Nectoux singles out \"the light footed episode in alternating fifths and sixths\" and its extremely delicate passagework, and points to the influence of Fauré\\'s former teacher Saint-Saëns in the allegro ma non troppo toccata section. Saint-Saëns himself declared the piece \"absolutely entrancing.\"\\nNocturne No. 3 in A♭ major, Op. 33/3 (c.1882)In the third nocturne, Morrison notes that the composer\\'s fondness for syncopation is at its gentlest, \"nostalgia lit by passion.\" Like its predecessors, it is in tripartite form. An expansive melody with syncopated left-hand accompaniment leads into a middle section in which a dolcissimo theme metamorphoses into bursts of passion. The return of the opening section is concluded by a gentle coda that introduces new harmonic subtleties.\\nNocturne No. 4 in E♭ major, Op. 36 (c.1884)The fourth nocturne, dedicated to the Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau, contrasts a lyrical opening section and an episode in E♭ minor with a sombre theme recalling the tolling of a bell. The first theme returns and is followed by a short coda. The pianist Alfred Cortot, generally a great admirer of Fauré, found the piece \"rather too satisfied with its languor.\"\\nNocturne No. 5 in B♭ major, Op. 37 (c.1884)By contrast with its predecessor, the fifth nocturne is more animated, with unexpected shifts into remote keys. Nectoux writes of its undulating outline, and the \"almost improvisatory, questioning character\" of the opening.\\n\\nNocturne No. 6 in D♭ major, Op. 63 (1894)The sixth nocturne, dedicated to Eugène d\\'Eichthal, is widely held to be one of the finest of the series. Cortot said, \"There are few pages in all music comparable to these.\"  Morrison calls it \"among the most rich and eloquent of all Fauré\\'s piano works.\" The pianist and writer Nancy Bricard calls it \"one of the most passionate and moving works in piano literature.\" Fauré wrote it after a six-year break from composing for the piano. The piece begins with an emotional, outpouring phrase, with echoes of Fauré\\'s song cycle  La bonne chanson. The second theme, at first seemingly tranquil, has what the composer Charles Koechlin calls a persistent inquietude, emphasised by the syncopated accompaniment. The initial theme returns, and is followed by a substantial development of a gentle, contemplative melody. A recapitulation of the principal theme takes the piece to its conclusion. Copland wrote that it was with this work that Fauré first fully emerged from the shadow of Chopin, and he said of the piece, \"The breath and dignity of the opening melody, the restless C sharp minor section which follows (with the peculiar syncopated harmonies so often and so well used by Fauré), the graceful fluidity of the third idea: all these elements are brought to a stormy climax in the short development section; then, after a pause, comes the return of the consoling first page.\"\\nNocturne No. 7 in C♯ minor, Op. 74 (1898)The seventh nocturne departs from the A–B–A form of Fauré\\'s earlier nocturnes; in Pinkas\\'s view is it constructed more like a ballade than a nocturne. It opens with a slow (molto lento) theme of harmonic ambiguity, followed by a second theme, equally ambiguous in key, though nominally in D major. The central section is in F♯ major, and the re-emergence of the first theme brings the piece to a conclusion. Morrison finds in this piece a sense of bleakness, and of the composer\\'s struggle against despair. Pinkas, however, regards the work as a \"contrast between ambiguity and joy, ending in reassurance.\" It is sometimes known as the \"English\" nocturne, having been composed while Fauré was staying in the UK, and being dedicated to the English pianist Adela Maddison.\\nNocturne No. 8 in D♭ major, Op. 84/8 (1902)Fauré did not intend the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His publisher collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as 8 pièces brèves, allocating each of them a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.\\n\\nNocturne No. 9 in B minor, Op. 97 (1908)The ninth nocturne, dedicated to Cortot\\'s wife, Clotilde Bréal, is the first of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré\\'s final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.\\nNocturne No. 10 in E minor, Op. 99 (1908)Like its immediate predecessor, the tenth nocturne is on a smaller scale than those of Fauré\\'s middle period. In contrast with the ninth, however, the tenth is darker and angrier. The composer applies the A–B–A form less rigorously than in earlier nocturnes, and the opening bars of the piece recur intermittently throughout, eventually building to a fierce climax, described by Morrison as \"a slow central climb ... that inhabits a world of nightmare.\" The piece ends with a calm coda. It is dedicated to Madame Brunet-Lecomte.\\nNocturne No. 11 in F♯ minor, Op. 104/1 (1913)The eleventh nocturne was written in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer\\'s own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.\\nNocturne No. 12 in E minor, Op. 107 (1915)With the twelfth nocturne Fauré returned to the scale and complexity of his middle-period works, but both melodically and harmonically it is much harder to comprehend. There are deliberate dissonances and harmonic ambiguities that Pinkas describes as \"taking tonality to its limit while still maintaining a single key.\" Morrison writes that \"the ecstatic song of No. 6 is transformed in a central section where lyricism is soured by dissonance, held up, as it were, to a distorting mirror.\" The work is in Fauré\\'s customary nocturne form, A–B–A, but with a reiteration of the material of the second section, harmonically transformed, followed by a coda that draws on material from the opening section.\\nNocturne No. 13 in B minor, Op. 119 (1921)Fauré scholars are generally agreed that the last nocturne – which was the last work he wrote for the piano – is among the greatest of the set. Nectoux writes that along with the sixth, it is \"incontestably the most moving and inspired of the series.\" Bricard calls it \"the most inspired and beautiful in the series.\" For Pinkas, the work \"achieves a perfect equilibrium between late-style simplicity and full-textured passionate expression.\" The work opens in a \"pure, almost rarefied atmosphere\" (Nectoux), with a \"tone of noble, gentle supplication ... imposing gravity and ... rich expressive four part writing.\" This is followed by an allegro, \"a true middle section in a virtuoso manner, ending in a bang\" (Pinkas). The repeat of the opening section completes the work.\\n\\n\\n== Barcarolles ==\\n\\nBarcarolles were originally folk songs sung by Venetian gondoliers. In Morrison\\'s phrase, Fauré\\'s use of the term was more convenient than precise. Fauré was not attracted by fanciful titles for musical pieces, and maintained that he would not use even such generic titles as \"barcarolle\" if his publishers did not insist. His son Philippe recalled, \"he would far rather have given his Nocturnes, Impromptus, and even his Barcarolles the simple title Piano Piece no. so-and-so.\"  Nevertheless, following the precedents of Chopin and most conspicuously Mendelssohn, Fauré made extensive use of the barcarolle, in what his biographer Jessica Duchen calls \"an evocation of the rhythmic rocking and lapping of water around appropriately lyrical melodies.\"Fauré\\'s ambidexterity is reflected in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard as well as in the bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.Like the nocturnes, the barcarolles span nearly the whole of Fauré\\'s composing career, and they similarly display the evolution of his style from the uncomplicated charm of the early pieces to the withdrawn and enigmatic quality of the late works. All are written with compound time signatures (6/8, 9/8, or 6/4).\\n\\nBarcarolle No. 1 in A minor, Op. 26 (1880)The first barcarolle was dedicated to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. Caroline Montigny-Rémaury) and premiered by Saint-Saëns at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique in 1882. The piece begins with an uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in 6/8 time. It develops into a more elaborate form before the introduction of the second theme, in which the melodic line is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass. Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional sweetness is enlivened by subtle dissonance.\\nBarcarolle No. 2 in G major, Op. 41 (1885)The second barcarolle, dedicated to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, and points to the influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 in the middle of the piece.\\nBarcarolle No. 3 in G♭ major, Op. 42 (1885)The third barcarolle is dedicated to Henriette Roger-Jourdain, wife of Fauré\\'s friend, the painter Roger-Joseph Jourdain. It opens with a simple phrase that is quickly elaborated into trills reminiscent of Chopin. The middle section, like that of the first, keeps the melody in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated ornaments above and below. The pianist Marguerite Long said that these ornaments \"crown the theme like sea foam.\"\\nBarcarolle No. 4 in A♭ major, Op. 44 (1886)One of the best-known of the set, the fourth barcarolle is \"tuneful, quite short, perhaps more direct than the others.\" (Koechlin).\\n\\nBarcarolle No. 5 in F♯ minor, Op. 66 (1894)Dedicated to Mme la Baronne V. d\\'Indy, the fifth barcarolle was written after a five-year period in which Fauré composed nothing for the piano. Orledge calls it powerful, agitated and virile. It is the first of Fauré\\'s piano works in which there are no identifiable sections; its changes are in metre, not in tempo.\\nBarcarolle No. 6 in E♭ major, Op. 70 (1896)Koechlin brackets the sixth and seventh of the set together as a contrasting pair. Both pieces show \"an economy of writing\", the sixth \"more moderate and tranquil in expression\". The Fauré scholar Roy Howat writes of a \"sensuous insouciance\" with an underlying virtuosity and wit under the \"deceptively nonchalant surface\".\\nBarcarolle No. 7 in D minor, Op. 90 (1905)The seventh barcarolle contrasts with its predecessor in being more restless and sombre, recalling Fauré\\'s \"Crépuscule\" from  his song cycle La chanson d\\'Ève.\\nBarcarolle No. 8 in D♭ major, Op. 96 (1906)Dedicated to Suzanne Alfred-Bruneau, the eighth barcarolle opens in with a cheerful theme, which soon gives way to melancholy. The second episode, in C♯ minor, marked cantabile, is succeeded by an abrupt ending with a fortissimo chord.\\nBarcarolle No. 9 in A minor, Op. 101 (1909)The ninth barcarolle, in Koechlin\\'s view, \"recalls, as in a hazy remoteness, the happiness of the past\". Nectoux writes that it consists of \"a series of harmonic or polyphonic variations on a strange, sombre, syncopated theme, whose monotony recalls some sailor\\'s song\".\\n\\nBarcarolle No. 10 in A minor, Op. 104/2 (1913)Dedicated to Madame Léon Blum, the tenth barcarolle stays more closely within conventional tonality than its predecessor, \"with a certain sedate gravity ... the monotony appropriate to a grey evening\" (Koechlin). The melancholy theme is reminiscent of Mendelssohn\\'s Venetian themes from Songs Without Words, but is developed in a way characteristic of Fauré, with \"increasingly animated rhythms and, at certain points, excessively complex textures\" (Nectoux).\\nBarcarolle No. 11 in G minor, Op. 105 (1913)Dedicated to Laura, daughter of the composer Isaac Albéniz. The eleventh and twelfth of the set can be viewed as another contrasting pair. The eleventh is severe in mood and in rhythm, reflecting the prevailing austerity of Fauré\\'s later style.\\nBarcarolle No. 12 in E♭ major, Op. 106bis (1915)Dedicated to Louis Diémer, the twelfth barcarolle is an allegretto giocoso. It opens in what was by now for Fauré a rare uncomplicated theme, in the traditional Venetian manner, but is developed in more subtle rhythms. Despite the increasing complexity of the polyphonic lines, Fauré keeps the melody prominent, and the piece ends with it transformed into \"a theme of almost triumphal character\" (Nectoux).\\nBarcarolle No. 13 in C major, Op. 116 (1921)The last of the set is dedicated to Magda Gumaelius. Koechlin writes of it: \"bare, superficially  almost dry, but at heart most expressive with that deep nostalgia for vanished bright horizons: sentiments that the composer suggests in passing rather than comments on in loquacious or theatrical oratory; he seemed to desire to preserve the soothing and illusory serenity of the mirage.\"\\n\\n\\n== Impromptus ==\\nImpromptu No. 1 in E♭ major, Op. 25 (1881)Cortot compared the first impromptu to a rapid barcarolle, redolent of \"sunlit water\", combining \"stylised coquetry and regret\".\\nImpromptu No. 2 in F minor, Op. 31 (1883)Dedicated to Mlle Sacha de Rebina, the second impromptu maintains an airy tarantella rhythm. It is scored less richly than the first of the set, giving it a lightness of texture.\\nImpromptu No. 3 in A♭ major, Op. 34 (1883)The third impromptu is the most popular of the set. Morrison calls it \"among Fauré\\'s most idyllic creations, its principal idea dipping and soaring above a gyrating, moto perpetuo accompaniment\". It is marked by a combination of dash and delicacy.\\nImpromptu No. 4 in D♭ major, Op. 91 (1906)Dedicated to \"Madame de Marliave\" (Marguerite Long), the fourth impromptu was Fauré\\'s return to the genre in his middle period. Unlike much of his music of the period, it avoids a dark mood, but Fauré had by now moved on from the uncomplicated charm of the first three of the set. His mature style is displayed in the central section, a contemplative andante, which is followed by a more agitated section that concludes the work.\\nImpromptu No. 5 in F♯ minor, Op. 102 (1909)Nectoux describes this impromptu as \"a piece of sheer virtuosity celebrating, not without humour, the beauties of the whole-tone scale.\" Morrison, however, writes that the work \"seethes with unrest\".\\nImpromptu in D♭ major, Op. 86 bis (Transcription of the Impromptu for harp, Op. 86, 1904)The last work in the published set was written before numbers four and five. It was originally a harp piece, composed for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1904. Cortot made a transcription for piano, published in 1913 as Fauré\\'s Op. 86 bis. The outer sections are light and brilliant, with a gentler central section, marked meno mosso.\\n\\n\\n== Valses-caprices ==\\nThe four valses-caprices are not a cycle, but rather two sets of two,  the first  from Fauré\\'s early period and the second from his middle period. Morrison calls all four \"more \\'caprice\\' than \\'waltz\\'\", and comments that they combine and develop the scintillating style of Chopin and Saint-Saëns waltzes. They show Fauré at his most playful, presenting variations before the theme is heard and darting in and out of unexpected keys.  Aaron Copland, though generally a keen admirer of Fauré\\'s music, wrote, \"the several Valses-Caprices, in spite of their admirable qualities, seem to me essentially foreign to Faure\\'s esprit. His is too orderly, too logical a mind to be really capricious.\" Cortot, by contrast, spoke approvingly of their \"sensual grace ... perfect distinction ... impassioned tenderness.\"\\nValse-caprice No. 1 in A major, Op. 30 (1882); and\\nValse-caprice No. 2 in D♭ major, Op. 38 (1884):Chopin\\'s influence is marked in the first two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No. 1 is remarkably similar to that at the end of Chopin\\'s Waltz in E minor. In No. 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d\\'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No. 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin\\'s Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.\\nValse-caprice No. 3 in G♭ major, Op. 59 (1887–93); and\\nValse-caprice No. 4 in A♭ major, Op. 62 (1893–94):Orledge writes that the second two valses-caprices are subtler and better integrated than the first two; they contain \"more moments of quiet contemplation and more thematic development than before.\" There still remain touches of virtuosity and traces of Liszt, and these two valses-caprices are, in Orledge\\'s words, the only solo pieces in the middle period to end in a loud and spectacular manner.\\nNo. 3 is dedicated to Mme. Philippe Dieterlen, No. 4 to Mme. Max Lyon.\\n\\n\\n== Other solo piano works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Romances sans paroles, Op. 17 ===\\n\\nFauré wrote these three \"songs without words\" while still a student at the École Niedermeyer, in about 1863. They were not published until 1880, but they then became some of his most popular works. Copland considered them immature pieces, which \"should be relegated to the indiscretions every young composer commits.\" Later critics have taken a less severe view; Morrison describes the Romances as \"an affectionate and very Gallic tribute to Mendelssohn\\'s urbanity, agitation and ease.\" The commentator Keith Anderson writes that although they were a popular French counterpart to Mendelssohn\\'s Songs without Words, Fauré\\'s own voice is already recognisable. Instead of placing the slowest piece in the middle of the set and ending with the lively A minor piece, Fauré, already with musical views of his own, switches the expected order, and the set ends pianissimo, fading to nothing.\\nAndante quasi allegrettoThe first romance, in A♭ major, has as an opening theme an uncomplicated melody with Mendelssohnian syncopations. The theme is presented first in the higher and then in the middle register, before flowing evenly to its conclusion.\\nAllegro moltoThe second romance, in A minor, an exuberant piece, has a strong semiquaver figure supporting the theme, and running high into the treble and low into the bass. This was later to become one of Fauré\\'s most recognisable characteristics. After a lively display, the piece ends quietly.\\nAndante moderatoThe final piece of the set, in A♭ major, is a serene andante, with a flowing tune in the Mendelssohnian style. After gentle variation, it equally gently fades to silence at the end.\\n\\n\\n=== Ballade in F♯ major, Op. 19 ===\\nThe Ballade, dedicated to Camille Saint-Saëns, dates from 1877, and is considered one of the three masterpieces of his youth, along with the first violin sonata and the first piano quartet. It is one of Fauré\\'s most substantial works for solo piano, but is better known in a version for piano and orchestra that he made in 1881 at Liszt\\'s suggestion. Playing for a little over 14 minutes, it is second in length only to the Thème et variations.  Fauré first conceived the music as a set of individual pieces, but then decided to make them into a single work by carrying the main theme of each section over into the following section as a secondary theme. The work opens with the F♯ major theme, an andante cantabile, which is followed by a faster section, marked allegro moderato, in E♭ minor. The third section is an andante introducing a third theme. In the last section, an allegro, a return of the second theme brings the work to a conclusion in which Nectoux comments, the treble sings with particular delicacy.Marcel Proust knew Fauré, and the Ballade is thought to have been the inspiration for the sonata by Proust\\'s character Vinteuil that haunts Swann in In Search of Lost Time.  Debussy, reviewing an early performance of the Ballade, compared the music with the attractive soloist, straightening her shoulder-straps during the performance: \"I don\\'t know why, but I somehow associated the charm of these gestures with the music of Fauré himself. The play of fleeting curves that is its essence can be compared to the movements of a beautiful woman without either suffering from the comparison.\" Morrison describes the Ballade as \"a reminder of halcyon, half-remembered summer days and bird-haunted forests\".\\n\\n\\n=== Mazurka in B♭ major, Op. 32 ===\\nThe Mazurka was composed in the mid-1870s but not published until 1883. It is a tribute to Chopin, and contains echoes of the earlier composer\\'s music. Chopin, however, composed more than 60 mazurkas, and Fauré wrote only this one. Morrison regards it as an experiment on Fauré\\'s part. The piece owes little to Polish folk-dance rhythms, and may have had a Russian influence through Fauré\\'s friendship with Sergei Taneyev at around the time of its composition.\\n\\n\\n=== Pavane, Op. 50 ===\\n\\nThe Pavane (1887) was conceived and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for piano in 1889. In the form of an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer\\'s sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism.\\n\\n\\n=== Thème et variations in C♯ minor, Op. 73 ===\\nWritten in 1895, when he was 50, this is among Fauré\\'s most extended compositions for piano, with a performance time of about 15 minutes. Although it has many passages that reflect the influence of Schumann\\'s Symphonic Studies, in Jessica Duchen\\'s words \"its harmonies and pianistic idioms\" are unmistakably those of Fauré. As in the earlier Romances sans paroles, Op. 17, Fauré does not follow the conventional course of ending with the loudest and most extrovert variation; the variation nearest to that description is placed next to last, and is followed by a gentle conclusion, \"a typically Faurean understated finish.\" Copland wrote of the work:\\n\\nCertainly it is one of Faure\\'s most approachable works. Even at first hearing it leaves an indelible impression. The \"Theme\" itself has the same fateful, march-like tread, the same atmosphere of tragedy and heroism, that we find in the introduction of Brahms\\'s First Symphony. And the variety and spontaneity of the eleven variations which follow bring to mind nothing less than the Symphonic Etudes. How many pianists, I wonder, have not regretted that the composer disdained the easy triumph of closing on the brilliant, dashing tenth variation. No, poor souls, they must turn the page and play that last, enigmatic (and most beautiful) one, which seems to leave the audience with so little desire to applaud.\\n\\n\\n=== Prelude to Pénélope ===\\nFauré\\'s opera based on the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first performed in 1913, after which the composer published a version of the prelude transcribed for piano. The piece, in G minor, contrasts a gravely noble andante moderato theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano.\\n\\n\\n=== 8 Pièces brèves, Op. 84 ===\\n\\nFauré did not intend these pieces to be published as a set; they were composed as individual works between 1869 and 1902. When Hamelle, his publishers, insisted on issuing them together as \"Eight Short Pieces\" in 1902, the composer successfully demanded that none of the eight must be allocated its own title. When he moved on to another publisher, Hamelle ignored his earlier instructions and issued subsequent editions with titles for each piece. Nectoux comments that the labelling of the eighth piece as \"Nocturne No. 8\" is particularly questionable (see Nocturne [No. 8], below). In the first decade of the 21st century the publisher Peters issued a new critical edition of the Eight Pieces with the spurious titles removed. The eight pieces take less than three minutes each in performance.Capriccio in E♭ major: Dedicated to Madame Jean Leonard Koechlin. Morrison calls it \"capricious indeed\", and notes a harmonic twist at the end \"as nonchalant as it is acrobatic\". It was originally written as a sight-reading test for students at the Paris Conservatoire, of which Fauré was the professor of composition from 1896 and director from 1905 to 1920.Fantaisie in A♭ major: Koechlin calls this piece a pleasant feuillet d\\'album.Fugue in A minor: This, like the other fugue in the set, is a revised version of a fugue Fauré composed at the start of his career, when he was a church organist in Rennes. They are both, in Koechlin\\'s view \"in a pleasant and correct style, obviously less rich than those in the Well-Tempered Clavier, and more careful, but whose reserve conceals an incontestable mastery\".Adagietto in E minor: An andante moderato, \"serious, grave, at once firm and pliant, attaining real beauty\" (Koechlin).Improvisation in C♯ minor: Orledge calls this piece a middle period \"song without words\". It was composed as a sight-reading test for the Conservatoire.Fugue in E minor: See Fugue in A minor, above.\\nAllégresse in C major: \"A bubbling perpetuum mobile whose surging romantic feelings are only just kept under restraint\" (Orledge). \"A song, pure and gay, uplifted to a sunlit sky, a youthful outpouring, full of happiness.\" (Koechlin).Nocturne [No. 8] in D♭ major: As noted above, this piece stands apart from the larger-scale works to which Fauré gave the title \"nocturne\".  It  would not be listed among them were it not for the publisher\\'s unauthorised use of the title in this case. It is the longest of the eight pieces of Op. 84, but is much shorter and simpler than the other 12 nocturnes, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.\\n\\n\\n=== 9 Préludes, Op. 103 ===\\n\\nThe nine préludes are among the least known of Fauré\\'s major piano compositions. They were written while the composer was struggling to come to terms with the onset of deafness in his mid-sixties. By Fauré\\'s standards this was a time of unusually prolific output.  The préludes were composed in 1909 and 1910, in the middle of the period in which he wrote the opera Pénélope, barcarolles Nos. 8–11 and nocturnes Nos. 9–11.In Koechlin\\'s view, \"Apart from the Préludes of Chopin, it is hard to think of a collection of similar pieces that are so important\". The critic Michael Oliver wrote, \"Fauré\\'s Préludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense directness ... more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity.\" Jessica Duchen calls them \"unusual slivers of magical inventiveness.\" The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play. The shortest of the set, No. 8, lasts barely more than a minute; the longest, No. 3, takes between four and five minutes.\\nPrélude No. 1 in D♭ majorAndante molto moderato. The first prélude is in the manner of a nocturne. Morrison refers to the cool serenity with which it opens, contrasted with the \"slow and painful climbing\" of the middle section.\\nPrélude No. 2 in C♯ minorAllegro. The moto perpetuo of the second prélude is technically difficult for the pianist; even the most celebrated Fauré interpreter can be stretched by it.  Koechlin calls it \"a feverish whirling of dervishes, concluding in a sort of ecstasy, with the evocation of some fairy palace.\"\\nPrélude No. 3 in G minorAndante. Copland considered this prélude the most immediately accessible of the set. \"At first, what will most attract you, will be the third in G-minor, a strange mixture of the romantic and classic.\" The musicologist Vladimir Jankélévitch wrote, \"it might be a barcarolle strangely interrupting a theme of very modern stylistic contour\".\\nPrélude No. 4 in F majorAllegretto moderato. The fourth prélude is among the gentlest of the set. The critic Alain Cochard writes that it \"casts a spell on the ear through the subtlety of a harmony tinged with the modal and its melodic freshness.\" Koechlin calls it \"a guileless pastorale, flexible, with succinct and refined modulations\".\\nPrélude No. 5  in D minorAllegro. Cochard quotes the earlier writer Louis Aguettant\\'s description of this prélude as \"This fine outburst of anger (Ce bel accès de colère)\". The mood is turbulent and anxious;  the piece ends in quiet resignation reminiscent of the \"Libera me\" of the Requiem.\\nPrélude No. 6 in E♭ minorAndante. Fauré is at his most classical in this prélude, which is in the form of a canon. Copland wrote that it \"can be placed side by side with the most wonderful of the Preludes of the Well-Tempered Clavichord.\"\\nPrélude No. 7 in A majorAndante moderato. Morrison writes that this prélude, with its \"stammering and halting progress\" conveys an inconsolable grief. After the opening andante moderato, it becomes gradually more assertive, and subsides to conclude in the subdued mood of the opening. The rhythm of one of Fauré\\'s best-known songs, \"N\\'est-ce-pas?\" from La bonne chanson, runs through the piece.\\nPrélude No. 8 in C minorAllegro. In Copland\\'s view this is, with the third, the most approachable of the Préludes, \"with its dry, acrid brilliance (so rarely found in Faure).\" Morrison describes it as \"a repeated-note scherzo\" going \"from nowhere to nowhere.\"\\nPrélude No. 9  in E minorAdagio. Copland described this prélude as \"so simple – so absolutely simple that we can never hope to understand how it can contain such great emotional power.\" The prélude is withdrawn in mood; Jankélévitch wrote that it \"belongs from beginning to end to another world.\" Koechlin notes echoes of the \"Offertoire\" of the Requiem throughout the piece.\\n\\n\\n== For two pianists ==\\n\\nSouvenirs de BayreuthSubtitled Fantasie en forme de quadrille sur les thèmes favoris de l\\'Anneau de Nibelung (\"Fantasy in the form of a quadrille on favourite themes from Der Ring des Nibelungen\"). Fauré admired the music of Wagner and was familiar with the smallest details of his scores, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner\\'s musical influence.\\nFrom 1878, Fauré and his friend and ex-pupil André Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw Das Rheingold and Die Walküre at Cologne Opera; the complete Ring cycle in Munich and London; and Die Meistersinger in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw Parsifal. They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth, written in about 1888. This short, skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from The Ring. It consists of five short sections in which Wagner\\'s themes are transformed into dance rhythms. The manuscript (in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris) is in Messager\\'s hand.\\nSuite d\\'orchestre, Op. 20Between 1867 and 1873, Fauré wrote a symphonic work for full orchestra. The piece was first heard in 1873 when Fauré and Saint-Saëns performed it in a two-piano version, but that transcription has not survived. Léon Boëllmann made a new transcription of the first movement in 1893.\\nDolly Suite, Op. 56\\n\\nThe Dolly Suite is a six-section work for piano duet. It was inspired by Hélène, nicknamed \"Dolly\", daughter of the singer Emma Bardac with whom Fauré was intimately associated in the 1890s. The opening piece was a present for Dolly\\'s first birthday, and Fauré added the other five pieces to mark her subsequent birthdays and other family occasions. Unusually for Fauré, who generally favoured strictly functional titles, the movements of the suite have whimsical titles associated with Dolly and her family.Its six movements take about fifteen minutes to perform. The first is a Berceuse, or cradle-song. \"Mi-a-ou\", despite a title suggesting a cat, in fact represents the infant Dolly\\'s attempts to pronounce the name of her brother Raoul; after \"Le jardin de Dolly\", the \"Kitty Valse\", again confounds its feline title, being a sketch of the family\\'s pet dog. After the gentle \"Tendresse\", the suite ends with a lively evocation of Spain, which, Orledge notes, is one of Fauré\\'s few purely extrovert pieces.\\nMasques et bergamasques, Op. 112From the orchestral suite drawn from his music for the stage presentation Masques et bergamasques, Fauré made a transcription for piano duet, which was published in 1919. Like the orchestral suite, it consists of four movements, titled \"Ouverture\", \"Menuet\", \"Gavotte\" and \"Pastorale\".\\n\\n\\n== Recordings ==\\nFauré made piano rolls of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913. The rolls that survive are of the \"Romance sans paroles\" No. 3, Barcarolle No. 1, Prelude No. 3, Nocturne No. 3, Thème et variations, Valses-caprices Nos 1, 3 and 4, and piano versions of the Pavane, and the \"Sicilienne\" from Fauré\\'s music for Pelléas and Mélisande. Several of these rolls have been transferred to CD. Recordings on disc were few until the 1940s. A survey by John Culshaw in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by Kathleen Long, including the Nocturne No. 6, Barcarolle No. 2, the Thème et Variations, Op. 73, and the Ballade Op. 19 in its orchestral version. Fauré\\'s music began to appear more frequently in the record companies\\' releases in the 1950s.\\nIn the LP and particularly the CD era, the record companies built up a substantial catalogue of Fauré\\'s piano music, performed by French and non-French musicians. The piano works were first recorded largely complete in the mid-1950s by Germaine Thyssens-Valentin, with later sets being made by Grant Johannesen (1961), Jean Doyen (1966–1969), Jean-Philippe Collard (1974), Paul Crossley (1984–85), Jean Hubeau (1988–89), and  Kathryn Stott (1995).  Recital selections of major piano works have been recorded by many pianists including Vlado Perlemuter (1989), Pascal Rogé (1990), and Kun-Woo Paik (2002).\\n\\n\\n== Notes and references ==\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\nAnderson, Keith (1993).

It is an undesirable characteristic that has been observed mostly in experimental swept-wing aircraft at high subsonic Mach numbers or high angle of attack.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nPitch-up problems were first noticed on high-speed test aircraft with swept wings. It was a common problem on the Douglas Skyrocket, which was used extensively to test the problem.\\nBefore the pitch-up phenomenon was well understood, it plagued all early swept-wing aircraft. In the F-100 Super Sabre it even got its own name, the Sabre dance. In aircraft with high-mounted tailplanes, like the F-101 Voodoo, recovery was especially difficult because the tailplane was placed directly in the wing wake during the pitch-up, causing deep stall (although the T-tail was meant to prevent pitch-up from starting in the first place). Deployment of the braking parachute and a considerable height above the ground were essential for a chance at recovery.\\n\\n\\n== Description ==\\n\\nWings generate pressure distributions on their upper and lower surfaces which produce a single force acting at a point known as the \"center of pressure\", or CoP, which is normally located between ⅓ and ½ of the way back from the leading edge. This upward and rearward leaning force is replaced by an equivalent pair of forces called lift and drag. The longitudinal position at which these forces act and the magnitude of the forces change with angle of attack. In addition a varying pitching moment exists for any force location other than the CoP. These changes lead  to a requirement to trim aircraft as they change their speed or power settings.Another major consideration for aircraft design is a vector addition of all of the weight terms of the parts of the aircraft, including the wing. This too can be reduced to a single weight term acting at some point along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, the \"center of gravity\", or CoG. If the wing is positioned so its CoP lies near CoG for the aircraft, in level flight the wing will lift the aircraft straight up. This reduces any net forces pitching the aircraft up or down, but for a number of reasons the two points are normally slightly separated and a small amount of force from the flight control surfaces is used to balance this out.The same basic layout is desirable for an aircraft with a swept wing as well. On a conventional rectangular wing, the CoP meets the aircraft at the point on the chord running directly out from the root. While the same analysis will reveal a center of pressure point for a swept wing, its location may be considerably behind the leading edge measured at the root of the wing. For highly swept planforms, the CoP may lie behind the trailing edge of the wing root, requiring the wing to meet the aircraft at a seemingly far-forward location.In this case of a swept wing, changes to the CoP with angle of attack may be magnified.The introduction of swept wings took place during a move to more highly tapered designs as well. Although it had long been known that an elliptical planform is \"perfect\" from an induced drag standpoint, it was also noticed that a linear taper of the wing had much the same effect, while being lighter. Research during the war led to widespread use of taper, especially in the post-war era. However, it had been noticed early on that such designs had unfavourable stall characteristics; as the tips were more highly loaded in high angles of attack, they operated closer to their stall point.\\nAlthough this effect was unfavourable in a conventional straight wing aircraft, on a swept-wing design it had unexpected and dangerous results. When the tips stall on a swept wing, the center of pressure, the average lift point for the wing as a whole, moves forward. This is because the section still generating considerable lift is further forward. This causes further nose-up force, increasing the angle of attack and causing more of the tip area to stall. This may lead to a chain reaction that causes violent nose-up pitching of the aircraft.\\nThis effect first noticed in the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket in August 1949, when a 0.6 G turn suddenly increased out of control to 6 G. This was not entirely surprising; the effect had been seen earlier in wind tunnel simulations. These effects can be seen at any speed; in the Skyrocket they occurred primarily in the transonic (the Weil-Gray criteria) but with more highly swept and tapered planforms, like on the North American F-100 Super Sabre, the effect was common at low speeds as well (the Furlong-McHugh boundary), when the aircraft flew at higher angles of attack in order to maintain lift at low speeds.In addition, swept wings tend to generate span wise flow of the boundary layer, causing some of the airflow to move \"sideways\" along the wing. This occurs all along the wing, but as one moves towards the tip the sideways flow increases, as it includes both the contribution of the wing at that point, as well as span wise flow from points closer to the root. This effect takes time to build up, at higher speeds the span wise flow tends to be blown off the back of the wing before it has time to become serious. At lower speeds, however, this can lead to a considerable buildup of the boundary layer at the wing tip, adding to the problems noted above.Finally, while not directly related to the effects above, it was common during the early jet age to use T-tail designs in order to keep the aerodynamic surfaces well clear of the jet engine area. In this case it is possible for a pitch-up event to cause the turbulent air behind the wing to flow across the horizontal stabilizer, making it difficult or impossible to apply nose-down pressure to counteract the pitch-up. Aircraft with low-mounted tail surfaces did not suffer from this effect, and in fact improved their control authority as the wing\\'s wake cleared the controls surfaces, flowing above it. This was not always enough to correct for the problem, however; the F-86 continued to suffer from pitch-up in spite of increasing nose-down pressure from the tail surfaces.\\n\\n\\n== Mitigation ==\\n\\nAs the primary causes of the pitch-up problem are due to spanwise flow and more loading at the tips, measures to address these issues can eliminate the problem. In early designs these were typically \"add-ons\" to an otherwise conventional wing planform, but in modern designs this is part of the overall wing design and normally controlled via the existing high-lift devices.\\nThe first known attempt to address these problems took place on the platform where they were first noticed, the Douglas Skyrocket. This took the form of a series of vortex generators added to the outboard portions of the wing, breaking up the boundary layer. However, this was found to have almost no effect in practice. Nevertheless, a similar solution was attempted on the Boeing B-47 Stratojet where it proved considerably more effective. This may have been helped by the presence of the podded engines, whose vertical mountings acted as barriers to span wise flow.\\nMore common solutions to the problem of spanwise flow is the use of a wing fence or the related dogtooth notch on the leading edge of the wing. This disrupts the flow and re-directs it rearward, while also causing the buildup of stagnant air inboard to lower the stall point. This does have an effect on overall airflow on the wing, and is generally not used where the sweep is mild.\\nTo address the problems with spanwise loading, a wider variety of techniques have been used, including dedicated slats or flaps, the use of washout or automated control of the ailerons. An unusual solution tried on the XF-91 Thunderceptor prototype fighter was to give the wingtips a wider chord than the wing roots. The idea was to increase wingtip efficiency and cause the wing roots to stall first.\\nAngle of attack sensors on the aircraft can also detect when the angle of attack approaches the attitude known to result in pitch-up and activate devices like the stick shaker to warn the pilot, and the stick pusher which overpowers the pilot and forces the nose of the aircraft down to a safer angle of attack. Twist or washout built into the wingtips can also alleviate pitch-up. In effect, the angle of attack at the wingtip becomes smaller than elsewhere on the wing, meaning that the inboard portions of the wing will stall first.\\nA commonly used solution to pitch-up in modern combat aircraft is to use a control-canard. Another modern solution to pitch-up is the use of slats. When slats are extended they increase wing camber and increase maximum lift coefficient.Pitch-up is also possible in aircraft with forward-swept wings as used on the Grumman X-29. With forward-swept wings the span wise flow is inboard, causing the wing root to stall before the wingtip. Although at first glance it would appear that this would cause pitch-down problems, the extreme rear mounting of the wing means that when the root stalls the lift moves forward, towards the tips.\\n\\n\\n== Sabre dance ==\\nWhen a swept wing starts to stall, the outermost portions tend to stall first. Since these portions are behind the center of pressure, the overall lift force moves forward, pitching the nose of the aircraft upwards. This leads to a higher angle of attack and causes more of the wing to stall, which exacerbates the problem. The pilot often loses control, with fatal results at low altitude because there was insufficient time for the pilot to regain control or eject before hitting the ground. A large number of aircraft were lost to this phenomenon during landing, which left aircraft tumbling onto the runway, often in flames.\\nOne of the most notorious incidents was the loss of F-100C-20-NA Super Sabre 54-1907 and its pilot during an attempted emergency landing at Edwards AFB, California on January 10, 1956. By chance, this particular incident was recorded in detail on 16 mm film by cameras set up to cover an unrelated test. The pilot fought desperately to regain control due to faulty landing technique, finally rolling and yawing to the right before striking the ground with the fuselage turned approximately 90 degrees to the line of flight. Anderson, 1993 states the F-100 was noticeably underpowered for its day and had very pronounced \"backside\" tendencies if airspeed was allowed to decay too much.\\nThe brand new F-100C was flown by Lt. Barty R. Brooks, a native of Martha, Oklahoma and a Texas A&M graduate, of the 1708th Ferrying Wing, Detachment 12, Kelly AFB, Texas. The aircraft was one of three being delivered from North American\\'s Palmdale plant to George AFB, California, but the nose gear pivot pin worked loose, allowing the wheel to swivel at random, so he diverted to Edwards, which had a longer runway. On approach, at a high angle of attack, the fighter exceeded its flight envelope, and, too far into stall condition, lost directional control with fatal results. These scenes were inserted in the movie The Hunters, starring Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner, in the movie X-15 with actor Charles Bronson playing the pilot, and in the made for TV film Red Flag: The Ultimate Game, although in The Hunters and in Red Flag: The Ultimate Game, the aircraft supposedly represented were respectively an F-86 and an F-5E. The incident was also commemorated in the fighter pilot song \"Give Me Operations\" (set to the tune of the California Gold Rush song \"What Was Your Name in the States?\"):\\n\"Don\\'t give me a One-Double-Oh\\nTo fight against friendly or foe\\nThat old Sabre Dance\\nMade me crap in my pants\\nDon\\'t give me a One-Double-Oh.\"\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nMach tuck\\nWing twist\\n\\n\\n=== References and Notes ===\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nLoftin, LK, Jr. \"Quest for performance: The evolution of modern aircraft.

It is an undesirable characteristic that has been observed mostly in experimental swept-wing aircraft at high subsonic Mach numbers or high angle of attack.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nPitch-up problems were first noticed on high-speed test aircraft with swept wings. It was a common problem on the Douglas Skyrocket, which was used extensively to test the problem.\\nBefore the pitch-up phenomenon was well understood, it plagued all early swept-wing aircraft. In the F-100 Super Sabre it even got its own name, the Sabre dance. In aircraft with high-mounted tailplanes, like the F-101 Voodoo, recovery was especially difficult because the tailplane was placed directly in the wing wake during the pitch-up, causing deep stall (although the T-tail was meant to prevent pitch-up from starting in the first place). Deployment of the braking parachute and a considerable height above the ground were essential for a chance at recovery.\\n\\n\\n== Description ==\\n\\nWings generate pressure distributions on their upper and lower surfaces which produce a single force acting at a point known as the \"center of pressure\", or CoP, which is normally located between ⅓ and ½ of the way back from the leading edge. This upward and rearward leaning force is replaced by an equivalent pair of forces called lift and drag. The longitudinal position at which these forces act and the magnitude of the forces change with angle of attack. In addition a varying pitching moment exists for any force location other than the CoP. These changes lead  to a requirement to trim aircraft as they change their speed or power settings.Another major consideration for aircraft design is a vector addition of all of the weight terms of the parts of the aircraft, including the wing. This too can be reduced to a single weight term acting at some point along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, the \"center of gravity\", or CoG. If the wing is positioned so its CoP lies near CoG for the aircraft, in level flight the wing will lift the aircraft straight up. This reduces any net forces pitching the aircraft up or down, but for a number of reasons the two points are normally slightly separated and a small amount of force from the flight control surfaces is used to balance this out.The same basic layout is desirable for an aircraft with a swept wing as well. On a conventional rectangular wing, the CoP meets the aircraft at the point on the chord running directly out from the root. While the same analysis will reveal a center of pressure point for a swept wing, its location may be considerably behind the leading edge measured at the root of the wing. For highly swept planforms, the CoP may lie behind the trailing edge of the wing root, requiring the wing to meet the aircraft at a seemingly far-forward location.In this case of a swept wing, changes to the CoP with angle of attack may be magnified.The introduction of swept wings took place during a move to more highly tapered designs as well. Although it had long been known that an elliptical planform is \"perfect\" from an induced drag standpoint, it was also noticed that a linear taper of the wing had much the same effect, while being lighter. Research during the war led to widespread use of taper, especially in the post-war era. However, it had been noticed early on that such designs had unfavourable stall characteristics; as the tips were more highly loaded in high angles of attack, they operated closer to their stall point.\\nAlthough this effect was unfavourable in a conventional straight wing aircraft, on a swept-wing design it had unexpected and dangerous results. When the tips stall on a swept wing, the center of pressure, the average lift point for the wing as a whole, moves forward. This is because the section still generating considerable lift is further forward. This causes further nose-up force, increasing the angle of attack and causing more of the tip area to stall. This may lead to a chain reaction that causes violent nose-up pitching of the aircraft.\\nThis effect first noticed in the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket in August 1949, when a 0.6 G turn suddenly increased out of control to 6 G.

Australia and New Zealand uses a North American-style league franchise system which means the teams are overwhelmingly privately owned and therefore favours relocation practices. Owners who move a team generally do so seeking better profits, facilities, fan support, or a combination of these.\\nThe two major professional sporting leagues in Australia are the Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL). Both competitions were originally based in one city (Melbourne and Sydney respectively) and expanded to a national level, and through that process, there have been team moves, mergers and closures in both leagues. The clubs are owned by members, not privately, but the North American franchise model exists, which means entry to the league is restricted. The hybrid model has meant that the leading promoter of moving is the league itself, trying to grow the football code by encouraging poorly performing clubs to move interstate.\\n\\n\\n== AFL ==\\nThe AFL is the national competition in Australian rules football and grew out of the mostly suburban Melbourne based Victorian Football League competition; as a result, the member clubs have had to move to adjust to a changing national focus.\\n\\n\\n=== Major interstate moves and mergers ===\\nSouth Melbourne Football Club: In 1982, it moved interstate to Sydney, 963 km north and became the Sydney Swans. Despite early struggles, the club has more than tripled its membership since, and has won premierships (championships) in 2005 and 2012.\\nFitzroy Football Club: In 1996, the Melbourne-based club merged its playing operations with the interstate Brisbane Bears, a club 1669 km north of its original home, with the Bears becoming the Brisbane Lions. Since the merger, the Brisbane club almost doubled its membership and won three consecutive premierships between 2001 and 2003. The Fitzroy Football Club ceased fielding a team in professional competitions, but it continues as a standalone entity based at its traditional home, and has fielded a team in the amateur Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) since 2009.\\n\\n\\n=== Suburban based club joins the National competition ===\\nThe Port Adelaide Football Club, established in 1870, participated in the SANFL competition until 1997 when the club joined the AFL. In 1997 the Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club was formed to maintain the clubs presence in the SANFL at the request of the SANFL winning premierships in 1998 and 1999. The Port Adelaide Football Club won the 2004 AFL Premiership and maintains strong links to its community in the Port Adelaide area. It is the only suburban club to join the national AFL competition with all other additions to the expanded VFL being composite sides or newly established clubs like the Sydney Swans, the Brisbane Bears ( see above ), West Coast, Adelaide, Fremantle, Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney.\\n\\n\\n=== Minor moves ===\\nSt Kilda Football Club - (1964) moved from the Junction Oval in St Kilda to the Moorabbin Oval in the South Eastern Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin. Two years, later they won their first and only premiership. (1993-1999) played their home games to Waverley Park in Mulgrave in Melbourne\\'s east. St Kilda were one of the first tenants of the new Colonial Stadium in 2000, but their administration remained at Moorabbin. In late 2007, it was confirmed that the club would leave Moorabbin to set up base in Seaford, Victoria, a region (the Mornington Peninsula) where the club added many supporters. The move was completed at the start of the 2011 season. The Saints moved their training and administration back to Moorabbin Oval in 2018.\\nHawthorn Football Club – (1973) moved from suburban Hawthorn to Princes Park in Carlton, an inner Northern suburb of Melbourne, and then to Waverley Park in 1991.  In 2000, the club moved its home games to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  In 2005, some years after Waverley Park\\'s demise as an official VFL/AFL venue, the club permanently moved to Waverley, but the name of the club did not change. The Hawks bought a plot of land in the locality of Dingley and plan to move their base to there in 2020/21.\\nBrisbane Bears – (1993) moved to the Brisbane Cricket Ground in Brisbane for the 1993 season and membership and attendances instantly tripled. Formed in 1986, the perhaps-incorrectly named side had initially established itself in Carrara, Queensland, a suburb of the city of Gold Coast, Queensland, some 80 km south of the city of Brisbane.\\nCollingwood Football Club – (1999) it played their last game at Victoria Park in Collingwood and moved to the larger and more central Melbourne Cricket Ground. The headquarters of the club moved to the Lexus Centre in Richmond, Victoria in 2005.\\nBrisbane Lions - (2022-2023) the club is moving its headquarters 25 kilometres west to a new purpose built venue at The Reserve, Springfield (Brighton Homes Arena) in the City of Ipswich, while the club will still play its home matches at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, the women\\'s AFLW club will play its home matches to the new stadium\\n\\n\\n=== Home ground-only moves ===\\nFitzroy Football Club: In 1967, the team moved its home ground from the Brunswick Street Oval in Fitzroy to Princes Park, Carlton.  In 1970, the club again moved its home game to the Junction Oval in 1970, then the Whitten Oval in 1984 before eventually merging with an interstate club.\\nEssendon Football Club – in 1993 moved their home ground from Windy Hill, Essendon to the larger and more central Melbourne Cricket Ground.  In 2000, the club again moved home games to the Telstra Dome, though the headquarters of the club remained in Essendon. In 2013 the Bombers moved their training and administration to Tullamarine.\\nPort Adelaide Football Club – in 1997, on admission to the AFL moved its home games to AAMI Stadium.  The club retained its administration and training base at Alberton Oval in Port Adelaide.\\nNorth Melbourne Football Club – in 2000 moved home ground to the Telstra Dome, but retained the Arden Street Oval in North Melbourne as official headquarters.\\nGeelong Football Club – in 2000, the provincial Victorian club became the AFL\\'s first true dual-home club, playing the larger games at the Telstra Dome 75 kilometres away in Melbourne.  The club\\'s administration remains based at Kardinia Park in Geelong.\\nFootscray Football Club – in 2002 moved permanently from the Whitten Oval in Footscray to the larger and more central Telstra Dome and changed their name to the Western Bulldogs, though the club\\'s headquarters is still in Footscray.\\nRichmond Football Club – moved their home games from Punt Road Oval next door to the much larger Melbourne Cricket Ground. The club still trains and has administration quarters at the Punt Road Oval.\\nMelbourne Football Club – During the re-development of their home, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the training and administration headquarters of the club were temporarily moved to Sandringham, Victoria with the Victorian Football League affiliate, the Sandringham Football Club. The club\\'s training headquarters are currently at the Junction Oval which proves troublesome during the summer as it is used for cricket.  The club removed the problems associated with separate administration and training headquarters moved all operation to its new headquarters at a refurbished Olympic Park Stadium in 2007. The club also use Casey Fields in Cranbourne East as a training center.\\nCarlton Football Club – at the end of the 2005 season moved from Optus Oval in Carlton, to the larger and more central Telstra Dome, although retained its administration headquarters at Princes Park. The club was the last suburban based Melbourne club to leave its former home ground.\\n\\n\\n=== Secondary interstate \\'homes\\' ===\\nSome Melbourne-based clubs began selling home games interstate in the late 1990s and conducting community camp clinics to build up local supporter bases.\\n\\nWestern Bulldogs – Darwin, Northern Territory since 2000 (approximately 1–2 games a year).  In 2007, the Bulldogs reduced their commitment to 1 game and signed a deal to also play 1 game a year in Canberra. They suspended their operations in Canberra in 2010, and stopped playing games in Darwin in 2013. They played 1 match a year in Cairns against the Gold Coast Suns from 2014 to 2018, and now play 1 game per year in Ballarat\\nSt Kilda Football Club – Launceston, Tasmania (approximately 2 games a year between 2002 and 2010).\\nHawthorn Football Club – Launceston, Tasmania (approximately 2 games a year between 2011 and 2015).  In 2015 they increased the number of games to 4 per year.\\nNorth Melbourne Football Club – in 1999, backed by the AFL, the club changed their trading name to the Kangaroos, and played a handful of home games interstate in Sydney.  The move proved unsuccessful, and the club has since played in Canberra for several years (2002–2006) before abandoning the area for the more lucrative, and potential goldmine at the Gold Coast, Queensland (2007–2008). However, the club pulled out from moving \\'home\\' games altogether after declining a league offer of a full move to the Gold Coast. The club then started playing 2 games a year in Hobart in 2013 and now play 4 games per year at Hobart\\'s Blundstone Arena as of 2017\\nMelbourne Football Club – a single home game a year to the Brisbane Lions at the Brisbane Cricket Ground in Queensland (2005–2007).  The Demons added a single game to Gold Coast, Queensland in Queensland in 2006.  In 2007, the Demons shifted its Gold Coast commitment to Canberra for a single game each year whilst also playing one game a year in Brisbane.The Demons abandoned operations in Canberra and the Gold Coast in 2011 after the addition of the Gold Coast Suns as a new AFL franchise, in 2014 the club started playing 1 game a year in Darwin and 1 game a year in Alice Springs\\n\\n\\n== A-League ==\\nNew Zealand Knights FC, who played in Auckland, New Zealand, were dissolved and moved to Wellington in 2004, becoming Wellington Phoenix FC. During the later stages of the 2006–07 A-League season, Football Federation Australia (FFA) removed New Zealand Knights A-League licence due to the club\\'s financial and administrative problems and poor on-field performance. After much delay, the final amount needed for the application came from Wellington property businessman Terry Serepisos in the latter stages of the bid. Serepisos, the club\\'s majority owner and chairman, provided NZD $1,000,000 to ensure the beginnings of a new New Zealand franchise and a continuation of New Zealand\\'s participation in the A-League. FFA finalised a three-year A-League licence to New Zealand Football who then sub-let the licence to the Wellington-based club. The new Wellington club was confirmed on March 19, 2007.\\nThe name for the new club was picked from a shortlist of six, pruned from 250 names suggested by the public, and was announced on March 28, 2007. Serepisos said of the name, that \"It symbolises the fresh start, the rising from the ashes, and the incredible Wellington support that has come out\".\\n\\n\\n== NRL ==\\nThe NRL is the national competition in rugby league and was born out of the Sydney-based Australian Rugby League and New South Wales Rugby League competitions. In 1987, the Western Suburbs Magpies agreed to move from its (inner) Western suburbs base to the outer south-western Macarthur district following a prior move west to Lidcombe Oval. In 1999, they merged with the remaining Inner Western team, the Balmain Tigers, (both teams having been established in 1908) to become Wests Tigers.\\nThe North Sydney Bears attempted to move from their Northern Suburbs base to the swiftly growing Central Coast region just north of Sydney in 1999, however problems with construction at the proposed home ground now known as Central Coast Stadium meant that the Bears continued to play home matches in a variety of Sydney grounds before being forced into a merger with the Manly Sea Eagles as the Northern Eagles. The merged clubs played home matches at both the Central Coast and Manly\\'s home ground of Brookvale Oval, but after the bears were expelled from the partnership, poor crowds at the former location led to a reversion to the name of Manly and games played exclusively at Brookvale Oval. Subsequently, one of the owners of Central Coast Stadium, John Singleton, has attempted to lure another club to play there, notably the South Sydney Rabbitohs who have experienced poor crowds at their new home ground of Stadium Australia.\\nThe Canterbury Bulldogs were formed in 1935 and played their first season without a home ground. In 1936, they settled at Belmore Sports Ground and played home matches there until the end of the 1998 season. The Bulldogs trialled a number of alternative home grounds during the 1990s, including Concord Oval in 1994.

The burnt nodules were ground to a fine powder. This product, made into a mortar with sand, set in 5–15 minutes. The success of Roman cement led other manufacturers to develop rival products by burning artificial mixtures of clay and chalk.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThere has been recent resurgence of interest in natural cements and Roman cements due mainly to the need for repair of façades done in this material in the 19th century. The major confusion involved for many people in this subject is the terminology used. Roman cement was originally the name given, by Parker, to the cement he patented which is a natural cement (i.e. it is a marl, or limestone containing integral clay, dug out of the ground, burnt and ground to a fine powder).In 1791, Parker was granted a patent \"Method of Burning bricks, Tiles, Chalk\". His second patent in 1796 \"A certain Cement or Terras to be used in Aquatic and other Buildings and Stucco Work\", covers Roman cement, the term he used in a 1798 pamphlet advertising his cement. He set up his manufacturing plant on Northfleetcreek, Kent. It was notably patented late on but James Parker is still the subject of all the credit.\\nLater, in the 1800s various sources of the correct type of marl, known also as cement stone, were discovered across Europe and so there were a range of natural cements (with varying properties) in use across Europe.An Austrian standard from 1880, providing a contemporary definition of Roman cements, reads: \"Roman cements are products obtained from argillaceous marlstones by burning below the sintering temperature. They do not slake in contact with water and must therefore be ground to a floury fineness.\"From around 1807 a number of people looked to make artificial versions of this cement (or more strictly hydraulic lime as it was not burnt at fusion temperatures).  Amongst these were James Frost who had about twenty patents from 1811 to 1822 including one for \"British Cement\" and in 1824 Joseph Aspdin, a British bricklayer from Leeds, with his now famous patent for a method of making a cement he called \"Portland cement\". This was done by adding various materials together to make an artificial version of natural cement. The name \"Portland cement\" is also recorded in a directory published in 1823 being associated with William Lockwood, Dave Stewart, and possibly others.\\n\\nThere then followed a number of independently discovered or copied versions of this \"Portland cement\" (also referred to as proto-Portland cement). Proto-Portland cement had a different chemical makeup from other natural cements being produced at the same time: It was burnt at a higher temperature than other Natural cements and thus crosses the barrier between traditional vertical kiln fired natural cement and the later horizontal kiln fired artificial cements. This cement is not, however, the same as the modern ordinary Portland cement, which can be defined as artificial cement.James Frost is reported to have erected a manufactory for making of an artificial cement in 1826. In 1843, Aspdin\\'s son William improved their cement, which was initially called \"Patent Portland cement,\" although he had no patent. In 1848, William Aspdin further improved his cement and in 1853, he moved to Germany where he was involved in cement making. William Aspdin made what could be called meso-Portland cement (a mix of Portland cement and hydraulic lime).Development in the 1860s of rotating horizontal kiln technology brought dramatic changes in properties, arguably resulting in modern cement. Certainly it is difficult to define whether an old render was a natural cement (single source marl) or an artificial one, but there is no doubt as whether the cement was fired in a vertical or horizontal kiln. The names natural cement or Roman cement then defines a cement coming from a single source rock. Early or proto-Portland cement could be used for early cement that comes from a number of sourced and mixed materials. There is no widely used terminology for these 19th-century cements. There had been, in order to rediscover this technology, two projects carried out by the European Union ROCEM and subsequently ROCARE (an ongoing project). Both these only deal with natural cement - referred to as Roman cement without reference to the early artificial cements.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nNotes\\nBibliographyThurston A P, Parker\\'s \"Roman\" Cement, Transactions of the Newcomen Society 1939 P193-206 (Newcomen Society)\\nMajor A J Francis, The Cement Industry 1796-1914 A History, 1977, Davis & Charles (Publishers) Ltd, Devon UK, North Pomfret Vermont US, North Vancouver Canada\\nWeber J, Mayr N, Bayer K, Hughes D, Kozłowski R, Stillhammerova M, Ullrich D, Vyskocilova R (2007) Roman cement mortars in Europe’s architectural heritage of the 19th century.

Saturnyne herself cares little for Dimples and sees him only as a useful servant.Saturnyne first came into contact with Brian Braddock, also known as Captain Britain, on the alternate Earth known as the Crooked World. This Earth is deemed to be a threat to the Omniverse and Saturnyne convinces Captain Britain to help evolve the backwards planet, hoping to eliminate its threat. They are opposed by the Status Crew, a group charged with maintaining the status quo. Saturnyne and Captain Britain manage to evolve the world, but are surprised when a bigger threat take its place: an alternate reality Mad Jim Jaspers uses his powers to create the Jaspers\\' Warp, causing widespread insanity and the collapse of reality. Captain Britain and Saturnyne want to stop him, but are stopped by the Fury, a killer machine. Saturnyne flees with her Avant Guard, leaving a heartbroken Dimples, Captain Britain and his sidekick Jackdaw behind. All three are killed by the Fury, shortly thereafter.The Dimensional Development Court arrest Saturnyne and replace her with a man called Mandragon, who destroys the Earth 238 universe to prevent the Jaspers Warp from spreading. Merlyn resurrects Captain Britain (but not Jackdaw), and the Fury manages to escape under his own power. Captain Britain and the interdimensional mercenaries known as the Special Executive help Saturnyne escape from the Court to Earth-616. On Earth-616, Mad Jim Jaspers, an even more powerful version than the one on Earth 238, comes into power and threatens the world. The Fury also makes its way to Earth-616 and  battles Jaspers. During the conflict, Merlyn dies (though later he would reveal that he had just faked his death). In the end the Fury kills Jaspers and is killed shortly afterwards by Captain Britain and Captain UK from Earth 238, with help from Saturnyne and the Special Executive. Saturnyne manages to obtain cell samples of Jaspers and threatens to unleash a clone on Mandragon\\'s world if he does not return her former position to her. Merlyn\\'s daughter Roma succeeds her father, and Saturnyne becomes an agent of Roma.Despite having cooperated with Captain Britain at various times, she comes into conflict with Captain Britain when she sends the bounty-hunters known as the Technet after Phoenix. The Technet fail to capture her and Phoenix joins Captain Britain, Shadowcat, Meggan and Nightcrawler to form Excalibur. Saturnyne later meets Phoenix in person, but does not capture her. Saturnyne rescinds her warrant against Phoenix but indefinitely extends the Technet\\'s exile on Earth. She also delivers a message from Roma asking the other Captain Britains to free Excalibur\\'s Captain Britain. Later events reveal that Saturnyne was acting under Roma\\'s orders when she originally sent the Technet against Phoenix, and that the Technet was meant to fail, resulting in the formation of Excalibur.Saturnyne remains Roma\\'s servant and Omniversal Majestrix for the following years until the villain Mastermind destroys the Captain Britain Corps and imprisons Roma before being defeated by Captain Britain. Saturnyne returns as Omniversal Majestrix, but has a bitter relationship with Brian, newly appointed ruler of Otherworld, whom she deems unworthy of his new position. She is summoned by Roma when the annihilistic cosmic entity Abraxas tries to destroy creation. While Roma is killed, Saturnyne shields Franklin and Valeria Richards from him.Saturnyne appears in a House of M tie-in story in Uncanny X-Men #462-465, which includes many classic Marvel UK characters. During X-Men: Die by the Sword, she blasts the resurrected Mad Jim Jaspers with a massive energy-weapon; Jaspers however pulls himself together again and threatens to kill her before members of the Exiles distracts him, allowing her to escape.During the Spider-Verse storyline, Saturnyne and Lady Roma express their concerns about the Incursions that are destroying many dimensions as Spider-UK arrives to express his concern about all the spiders across the multiverse being hunted and killed. Saturnyne rebuffs him, but Roma sympathizes with him and gives him a talisman that allows him to travel through the web of life in order to save all the remaining spiders.Ultimately, Saturnyne is forced to confront the growing threat of the Incursions when the destruction of the various universes leads to the deaths of many members of the Captain Britain Corps. Saturnyne captures a Map Maker and attempts to use it to determine the cause of the Incursions. This instead brings forth an army of Map Maker robots which slaughter the Captain Britain Corps, Roma, and ultimately Saturnyne. Her last act is to place the secrets of the Starlight Citadel into the 616 Captain Britain\\'s brain so that he can warn the Illuminati.As of the 2019 series Excalibur (v4), Saturnyne has been restored to life and is now referred to by some characters as the White Witch, and has gained a new enemy, the ancient mutant Apocalypse/En Sabah Nur. It is also stated that she has replaced Roma Regina as the Omniversal Guardian, but remains referred to as the Omniveral Majestrix by her minions.\\n\\n\\n== Characterization ==\\nAccording to Alan Davis, Dave Thorpe\\'s original script had specified Saturnyne\\'s appearance to be based on American actress Veronica Lake. Davis has explained that Saturnyne \"enjoys power, and she\\'s a bit of an ice princess, which is why she\\'s silver and blue, with a cold appearance\". The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z of 2008/09 describes Saturnyne as having a Machiavellian mind and being a cunning strategist, and while not being outright brilliant (listed as a three on a scale of seven in intelligence), her indomitable strength of will and ambition has allowed her to ascend to her lofty position through hard work without being born into it.\\n\\n\\n== Other versions ==\\nSaturnyne has counterparts on many worlds. The most important among these are:\\n\\n\\n=== Courtney Ross ===\\nCourtney Ross is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character originated in the Captain Britain comics as Brian Braddock\\'s college girlfriend, and was created by Chris Claremont and drawn by artists Herb Trimpe and Fred Kida. Later she was murdered and impersonated by her multiversal counterpart Sat-Yr-9, a twisted version of Saturnyne; it has remained ambiguous whether Courtney has actually returned at all since her death or been Sat-Yr-9 all along.\\nCourtney Ross came from a wealthy family and went to Thames University, London, where she met and started to date Brian Braddock, not knowing that Brian was in fact the superhero Captain Britain. She later found out about his secret life, but the two remained lovers. Captain Britain went missing shortly afterwards and Courtney assumed that he had died. When he returned, Brian fell in love with the mutant Meggan and it would be years before he would meet Courtney again.Courtney met Brian Braddock again, when he had become a member of Excalibur. She had become a successful city banker nicknamed The Ice Queen. She now no longer dyed her hair, and Brian was surprised that Courtney with blond hair looked exactly like his old acquaintance Saturnyne, her counterpart from another universe.\\n\\nBrian and Courtney resumed their friendship, shortly before she was attacked by Arcade and the Crazy Gang. Confronted in her offices, she manages to fight through the Crazy Gang\\'s forces and escape the building, but Arcade, hiding in a fake police car, captures her and takes her to a new Murderworld. There she was forced to improvise comedy in order to survive, surprising both herself and Arcade by being sufficiently entertaining to survive until she was rescued by Excalibur. Returning home after surviving Arcade\\'s assassination attempt and enjoying the thrill of danger, she was vaporized by another counterpart from an alternate universe, Opul Lun Sat-Yr-9.\\n\\n\\n=== Sat-Yr-9 ===\\nOpul Lun Sat-Yr-9 was the dictator of Earth-794, along with her lover Kaptain Briton. As a child, Sat-Yr-9 exhibited psychopathic behavior such as killing animals for amusement and later killed her parents and siblings at the age of 18, always dreaming about becoming Mastrex of the dictatorship True Briton. Her political rivals followed the same fate until she had achieved her goals. Unlike Saturnyne and Courtney, Sat-Yr-9 possesses mind-control abilities possibly derived from pheromone manipulation and hypnosis skills. A similar counterpart exists on Earth-1124, where she is visited by the Deathlok of Earth-7484 and the Killraven of Earth-691, attempting to seduce and offering herself to Killraven, although he ultimately resists her and returns to Earth X. When Kaptain Briton flees to Earth-616, where he has an identical looking counterpart, Captain Britain, Sat-Yr-9 sends armored troops to retrieve him. They mistakenly attack Captain Britain twice, but are repelled on each occasion. Sat-Yr-9 hires the interdimensional mercenary group, the Technet, but Briton swaps places with Britain, and the Technet take the wrong man back to Earth-794. Britain later convinces the Technet of their error.  When Sat-Yr-9 tries to stop them departing with Britain, the Technet slaughter her soldiers; the already psychotic Sat-Yr-9 becomes completely unhinged. She kills her subjects, leading Roma to send Captain UK on a mission to overthrow and imprison her. Later, Sat-Yr-9 seizes the opportunity to escape when an unassuming dimensional traveller from Earth-616 inadvertently enters her cell; she kills him, steals his suit and exits through the portal he came through.After murdering Courtney on Earth-616, Sat-Yr-9 takes on her identity. Sat-Yr-9 knew about Jamie Braddock\\'s reality warping powers before anyone else (including Jamie himself), since she has already encountered Jamie\\'s alternate reality counterpart. Sat-Yr-9 challenges Ross\\'s coworker (and secret admirer) Nigel Frobisher to a high-stakes card game at the London Hellfire Club, and wins. Frobisher agrees to serve her, and she orders him to rescue the Earth-616 Jamie Braddock from Doc Croc, intending to use his powers as a living weapon against her adversaries. Sat-Yr-9 takes Kitty Pryde under her guidance, enrolling Kitty in the St. Searle\\'s School for Young Ladies, and arranges a deal to save St. Searle\\'s from bankruptcy. Sat-Yr-9 later unmasks herself, revealing to Brian that she murdered Courtney and has taken her place; he swears revenge on the impostor for the crime as she and Jamie leaves.Still posing as the Earth-616\\'s Courtney Ross, she has joined the Hellfire Club as its White Queen, with Viper, a former HYDRA assassin, as her self-proclaimed \"White Princess\" and bodyguard. Someone claiming to be Courtney Ross has been seen in issues of Uncanny X-Men during the House of M crossover, as well as in the early issues of New Excalibur. Upon meeting Captain Britain during the House of M event, she was attacked and was accused of being her impostor, Sat-Yr-9, but upon revealing that she did not possess a tattoo on her thigh, was believed to be the true Courtney Ross (possibly resurrected as a side-effect of House of M). The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe does not confirm if this was the true Courtney Ross, resurrected, or Sat-Yr-9 continuing to pose as her. She is then shown sacrificing herself to save Captain Britain from an attack by the Omega Sentinel. After the events of House of M, Sat-Yr-9 returns. She tries to convince Captain Britain that she is the real Courtney Ross, although he is still unconvinced. Later on, he has warmed up to the idea of Courtney actually being herself again, referring to her as Courtney and confiding in her.\\n\\n\\n=== Sat\\'neen ===\\nSat\\'neen is a princess and sorceress from Earth 148, lover of Kylun, killed by Necrom.\\n\\n\\n=== Queen Mother ===\\nQueen of England in Earth-1193, a world filled with magic and mystical creatures, who coexist with humans.

Together with Mikkeli, it is one of the largest towns in the South Savonia region and one of the concentrations in the region\\'s hospital districts. The town is internationally known for its medieval St. Olaf\\'s Castle and the annual Savonlinna Opera Festival. Its surrounding the enclaved municipality of Enonkoski.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe city was founded in 1639, based on Olavinlinna castle (St. Olaf\\'s Castle). The castle was founded by Erik Axelsson Tott in 1475 in an effort to protect Savonia and to control the unstable border between the Kingdom of Sweden and its Russian adversary. During the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743), the castle was captured by Field-Marshal Peter Lacy. It was held by Russia between 1743 and 1812, when it was granted back to Finland as a part of \"Old Finland\".\\nIn 1973 the municipality of Sääminki was consolidated with Savonlinna. In the beginning of year 2009 the municipality of Savonranta and a 31.24 km2 (12.06 sq mi) land strip from Enonkoski between Savonlinna and Savonranta were consolidated with Savonlinna. In the beginning of the year 2013, the municipalities of Kerimäki and Punkaharju were consolidated with Savonlinna.\\n\\n\\n== Transport ==\\nSavonlinna is located 104 kilometres (65 mi) east of Mikkeli, 133 kilometres (83 mi) west of Joensuu and 159 kilometres (99 mi) south of Kuopio. It is also 335 kilometres (208 mi) from the capital city of Helsinki by road, and some four hours away by train. Flights from Savonlinna Airport to Helsinki take 40–60 minutes.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nThe University of Eastern Finland had a campus in Savonlinna, primarily for teacher education. The campus  was shut down in 2018. South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences has a campus in Savonlinna, teaching healthcare as well as process technologies. Research and development facilities include laboratories for wood processing and electronics.There are two high schools in Savonlinna. One of these high schools is specialized in art subjects, which when it started its operation in 1967 was the first specialized high school in Finland as well as in all of the Nordic countries.\\n\\n\\n== Attractions ==\\nThe most notable attraction in Savonlinna is the Olavinlinna castle, a 15th-century castle built on an island. Near the castle is also the regional museum. Some other attractions include the forest museum Lusto in the village of Punkaharju, and the Kerimäki Church in the neighboring village of Kerimäki, which is the largest wooden church in the world.\\nSavonlinna hosts the famous annual Savonlinna Opera Festival, which was held first time in 1912. The operas are performed on a stage built inside the Olavinlinna castle.

Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion, its practitioners often regard it as Japan\\'s indigenous religion and as a nature religion. Scholars sometimes call its practitioners Shintoists, although adherents rarely use that term themselves. There is no central authority in control of Shinto and much diversity exists among practitioners.\\nShinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami, supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things. The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic. The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines, family shrines, and jinja public shrines. The latter are staffed by priests, known as kannushi, who oversee offerings of food and drink to the specific kami enshrined at that location. This is done to cultivate harmony between humans and kami and to solicit the latter\\'s blessing. Other common rituals include the kagura dances, rites of passage, and seasonal festivals. Public shrines also supply religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion\\'s adherents and facilitate forms of divination. Shinto places a major conceptual focus on ensuring purity, largely by cleaning practices such as ritual washing and bathing, especially before worship. Little emphasis is placed on specific moral codes or particular afterlife beliefs, although the dead are deemed capable of becoming kami. The religion has no single creator or specific doctrinal text, but exists in a diverse range of local and regional forms.\\nAlthough historians debate at what point it is suitable to refer to Shinto as a distinct religion, kami veneration has been traced back to Japan\\'s Yayoi period (300 BC to AD 300). Buddhism entered Japan at the end of the Kofun period (AD 300 to 538) and spread rapidly. Religious syncretization made kami worship and Buddhism functionally inseparable, a process called shinbutsu-shūgō. The kami came to be viewed as part of Buddhist cosmology and were increasingly depicted anthropomorphically. The earliest written tradition regarding kami worship was recorded in the 8th-century Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. In ensuing centuries, shinbutsu-shūgō was adopted by Japan\\'s Imperial household. During the Meiji era (1868 to 1912), Japan\\'s nationalist leadership expelled Buddhist influence from kami worship and formed State Shinto, which some historians regard as the origin of Shinto as a distinct religion. Shrines came under growing government influence and citizens were encouraged to worship the emperor as a kami. With the formation of the Japanese Empire in the early 20th century, Shinto was exported to other areas of East Asia. Following Japan\\'s defeat in World War II, Shinto was formally separated from the state.\\nShinto is primarily found in Japan, where there are around 100,000 public shrines, although practitioners are also found abroad. Numerically, it is Japan\\'s largest religion, the second being Buddhism. Most of the country\\'s population takes part in both Shinto and Buddhist activities, especially festivals, reflecting a common view in Japanese culture that the beliefs and practices of different religions need not be exclusive. Aspects of Shinto have also been incorporated into various Japanese new religious movements.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\n\\nThere is no universally agreed definition of Shinto. However, the authors Joseph Cali and John Dougill stated that if there was \"one single, broad definition of Shinto\" that could be put forward, it would be that \"Shinto is a belief in kami\", the supernatural entities at the centre of the religion. The Japanologist Helen Hardacre stated that \"Shinto encompasses doctrines, institutions, ritual, and communal life based on kami worship\", while the scholar of religion Inoue Nobutaka observed the term was \"often used\" in \"reference to kami worship and related theologies, rituals and practices.\" Various scholars have referred to practitioners of Shinto as Shintoists, although this term has no direct translation in the Japanese language.Scholars have debated at what point in history it is legitimate to start talking about Shinto as a specific phenomenon. The scholar of religion Ninian Smart for instance suggested that one could \"speak of the kami religion of Japan, which lived symbiotically with organized Buddhism, and only later was institutionalized as Shinto.\" While various institutions and practices now associated with Shinto existed in Japan by the 8th century, various scholars have argued that Shinto as a distinct religion was essentially \"invented\" during the 19th century, in Japan\\'s Meiji era. The scholar of religion Brian Bocking stressed that, especially when dealing with periods before the Meiji era, the term Shinto should \"be approached with caution\". Inoue Nobutaka stated that \"Shinto cannot be considered as a single religious system that existed from the ancient to the modern period\", while the historian Kuroda Toshio noted that \"before modern times Shinto did not exist as an independent religion\".\\n\\n\\n=== Categorization ===\\nMany scholars describe Shinto as a religion. However, some practitioners prefer to view Shinto as a \"way\", thus characterising it more as custom or tradition than religion, partly as a pretence for attempting to circumvent the modern Japanese separation of religion and state and restore Shinto\\'s historical links with the Japanese state. Moreover, religion as a concept arose in Europe and many of the connotations that the term has in Western culture \"do not readily apply\" to Shinto. Unlike religions familiar in Western countries, such as Christianity and Islam, Shinto has no single founder, nor any single canonical text. Western religions tend to stress exclusivity, but in Japan, it has long been considered acceptable to practice different religious traditions simultaneously. Japanese religion is therefore highly pluralistic. Shinto is often cited alongside Buddhism as one of Japan\\'s two main religions, and the two often differ in focus, with Buddhism emphasising the idea of transcending the cosmos, which it regards as being replete with suffering, while Shinto focuses on adapting to the pragmatic requirements of life. Shinto has integrated elements from religious traditions imported into Japan from mainland Asia, such as Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Chinese divination practices. It bears many similarities with other East Asian religions, in particular through its belief in many deities.\\n\\nScholars of religion have debated how to classify Shinto. Inoue considered it part of \"the family of East-Asian religions\". The philosopher Stuart D. B. Picken suggested that Shinto be classed as a world religion, while the historian H. Byron Earhart called it a \"major religion\". In the early 21st century it became increasingly common for practitioners to call Shinto a nature religion. It is also often described as an indigenous religion, although this generates debates over the various different definitions of \"indigenous\" in the Japanese context. The notion of Shinto as Japan\\'s \"indigenous religion\" stemmed from the growth of modern nationalism in the Edo period to the Meiji era; this view promoted the idea that Shinto\\'s origins were prehistoric and that it represented something like the \"underlying will of Japanese culture\". The prominent Shinto theologian Sokyo Ono, for instance, said kami worship was \"an expression\" of the Japanese \"native racial faith which arose in the mystic days of remote antiquity\" and that it was \"as indigenous as the people that brought the Japanese nation into existence\". Many scholars regard this classification as inaccurate. Earhart noted that Shinto, in having absorbed much Chinese and Buddhist influence, was \"too complex to be labelled simply\" as an \"indigenous religion\".There is substantial local variation in how Shinto is practiced; the anthropologist John K. Nelson noted it was \"not a unified, monolithic entity that has a single center and system all its own\". Different types of Shinto have been identified. \"Shrine Shinto\" refers to the practices centred around shrines, and \"Domestic Shinto\" to the ways in which kami are venerated in the home. Some scholars have used the term \"Folk Shinto\" to designate localised Shinto practices, or practices outside of an institutionalised setting. In various eras of the past, there was also a \"State Shinto\", in which Shinto beliefs and practices were closely interlinked with the Japanese state. In representing \"a portmanteau term\" for many varied traditions across Japan, the term \"Shinto\" is similar to the term \"Hinduism\", used to describe varied traditions across South Asia.\\n\\n\\n=== Etymology ===\\n\\nThe term Shinto is often translated into English as \"the way of the kami\", although its meaning has varied throughout Japanese history. Other terms are sometimes used synonymously with \"Shinto\"; these include kami no michi (神の道, \"the way of the kami\"), kannagara no michi (神ながらの道, also written 随神の道 or 惟神の道, \"the way of the kami from time immemorial\"), Kodō (古道, \"the ancient way\"), Daidō (大道, \"the great way\"), and Teidō (帝道, \"the imperial way\").The term Shinto derives from the combination of two Chinese characters: shen (神), which means \"spirit,\" and dao (道), which means \"way\", \"road\" or \"path\". The Chinese term Shendao was originally adopted into Japanese as Jindō; this was possibly first used as a Buddhist term to refer to non-Buddhist deities. Among the earliest known appearances of the term Shinto in Japan is in the 8th-century text, Nihon Shoki. Here, it may be a generic term for popular belief, or alternatively reference Taoism, as many Taoist practices had recently been imported from mainland Asia. In these early Japanese uses, the word Shinto did not apply to a distinct religious tradition nor to anything uniquely Japanese; the 11th century Konjaku monogatarishui for instance refers to a woman in China practicing Shinto, and also to people in India worshipping kami, indicating these terms were being used to describe religions outside Japan itself.In medieval Japan, kami-worship was generally seen as being part of Japanese Buddhism, with the kami themselves often interpreted as Buddhas. At this point, the term Shinto increasingly referred to \"the authority, power, or activity of a kami, being a kami, or, in short, the state or attributes of a kami.\" It appears in this form in texts such as Nakatomi no harai kunge and Shintōshū tales. In the Japanese Portuguese Dictionary of 1603, Shinto is defined as referring to \"kami or matters pertaining to kami.\" The term Shinto became common in the 15th century. During the late Edo period, the kokugaku scholars began using the term Shinto to describe what they believed was an ancient, enduring and indigenous Japanese tradition that predated Buddhism; they argued that Shinto should be used to distinguish kami worship from traditions like Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. This use of the term Shinto became increasingly popular from the 18th century. The term Shinto has been commonly used only since the early 20th century, when it superseded the term taikyō (\\'great religion\\') as the name for the Japanese state religion.\\n\\n\\n== Beliefs ==\\n\\n\\n=== Kami ===\\n\\nShinto is polytheistic, involving the veneration of many deities known as kami, or sometimes as jingi. As is often the case in Japanese, no distinction is made here between singular and plural, and hence the term kami refers both to individual kami and the collective group of kami. Although lacking a direct English translation, the term kami has sometimes been rendered as \"god\" or \"spirit\"; the historian of religion Joseph Kitagawa stated that these English translations were \"quite unsatisfactory and misleading\", and various scholars urge against translating kami into English. In Japanese, it is often said that there are eight million kami, a term which connotes an infinite number, and Shinto practitioners believe that they are present everywhere. They are not regarded as omnipotent, omniscient, or necessarily immortal.The term kami is \"conceptually fluid\", and \"vague and imprecise\". In Japanese it is often applied to the power of phenomena that inspire a sense of wonder and awe in the beholder. Kitagawa referred to this as \"the kami nature\", stating that he thought it \"somewhat analogous\" to the Western ideas of the numinous and the sacred. Kami are seen to inhabit both the living and the dead, organic and inorganic matter, and natural disasters like earthquakes, droughts, and plagues; their presence is seen in natural forces such as the wind, rain, fire, and sunshine. Accordingly, Nelson commented that Shinto regards \"the actual phenomena of the world itself\" as being \"divine\". The Shinto understanding of kami has also been characterised as being animistic.In Japan, kami have been venerated since prehistory, and in the Yayoi period were regarded as being formless and invisible. It was only under the influence of Buddhism that they were depicted anthropomorphically; statues of the kami are known as shinzo. Kami are usually associated with a specific place, often one that is noted as a prominent feature in the landscape such as a waterfall, mountain, large rock, or distinctive tree. Physical objects or places in which the kami are believed to have a presence are termed shintai; objects inhabited by the kami that are placed in the shrine are known as go-shintai. Objects commonly chosen for this purpose include mirrors, swords, stones, beads, and inscribed tablets. These go-shintai are concealed from the view of visitors, and may be hidden inside boxes so that even the priests do not know what they look like.Kami are believed to be capable of both benevolent and destructive deeds; if warnings about good conduct are ignored, the kami can mete out punishment called shinbatsu, often taking the form of illness or sudden death. Some kami, referred to as the magatsuhi-no-kami or araburu kami, are regarded as being essentially malevolent and destructive. Offerings and prayers are given to the kami to gain their blessings and to dissuade them from engaging in destructive actions. Shinto seeks to cultivate and ensure a harmonious relationship between humans and the kami and thus with the natural world. More localised kami may be subject to feelings of intimacy and familiarity from members of the local community that are not directed towards more widespread kami like Amaterasu. The kami of a particular community is referred to it as their ujigami, while that of a particular house is the yashikigami.Kami are not deemed metaphysically different from humanity, with it being possible for humans to become kami. Dead humans are sometimes venerated as kami, being regarded as protector or ancestral figures. One of the most prominent examples is that of the Emperor Ōjin, who on his death was enshrined as the kami Hachiman, believed to be a protector of Japan and a kami of war. In Japanese culture, ancestors can be viewed as a form of kami. In Western Japan, the term jigami is used to describe the enshrined kami of a village founder. In some cases, living human beings were also viewed as kami; these were called akitsumi kami or arahito-gami. In the State Shinto system of the Meiji era, the emperor of Japan was declared to be a kami, while several Shinto sects have also viewed their leaders as living kami.\\n\\nAlthough some kami are venerated only in a single location, others have shrines devoted to them across many areas of Japan. Hachiman for instance has around 25,000 shrines dedicated to him. The act of establishing a new shrine to a kami who already has one is called bunrei (\"dividing the spirit\"). As part of this, the kami is invited to enter a new place, where it can be venerated, with the instalment ceremony known as a kanjo. The new, subsidiary shrine is known as a bunsha. Individual kami are not believed to have their power diminished by their residence in multiple locations, and there is no limit on the number of places a kami can be enshrined. In some periods, fees were charged for the right to enshrine a particular kami in a new place. Shrines are not necessarily always designed as permanent structures.Many kami are believed to have messengers, known as kami no tsukai or tsuka washime, and these are generally depicted as taking animal forms. The messenger of Inari, for example, is depicted as a fox (kitsune), while the messenger of Hachiman is a dove.\\nShinto cosmology also includes bakemono, spirits who cause malevolent acts. Bakemono include oni, tengu, kappa, mononoke, and yamanba. Japanese folklore also incorporates belief in the goryō or onryō, unquiet or vengeful spirits, particularly of those who have died violently and without appropriate funerary rites. These are believed to inflict suffering on the living, meaning that they must be pacified, usually through Buddhist rites but sometimes through enshrining them as a kami. Other Japanese supernatural figures include the tanuki, animal like creatures who can take human form.\\n\\n\\n=== Cosmogony ===\\n\\nThe origin of the kami and of Japan itself are recounted in two eighth-century texts, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, although the accounts they provide differ in part. Drawing heavily on Chinese influence, these texts were commissioned by ruling elites to legitimize and consolidate their rule. Although never of great importance to Japanese religious life, in the early 20th century the government proclaimed that their accounts were factual.The Kojiki recounts that the universe started with ame-tsuchi, the separation of light and pure elements (ame, \"heaven\") from heavy elements (tsuchi, \"earth\"). Three kami then appeared: Amenominakanushi, Takamimusuhi no Mikoto, and Kamimusuhi no Mikoto. Other kami followed, including a brother and sister, Izanagi and Izanami. The kami instructed Izanagi and Izanami to create land on earth. To this end, the siblings stirred the briny sea with a jewelled spear, from which Onogoro Island was formed. Izanagi and Izanami then descended to Earth, where the latter gave birth to further kami. One of these was a fire kami, whose birth killed Izanami. Izanagi then descended to the netherworld (yomi) to retrieve his sister, but there he saw her body putrefying. Embarrassed to be seen in this state, she chased him out of yomi, and he closed its entrance with a boulder.Izanagi bathed in the sea to rid himself from the pollution brought about by witnessing Izanami\\'s putrefaction. Through this act, further kami emerged from his body: Amaterasu (the sun kami) was born from his left eye, Tsukuyomi (the moon kami) from his right eye, and Susanoo (the storm kami) from his nose. Susanoo behaved in a destructive manner, and to escape him Amaterasu hid herself within a cave, plunging the earth into darkness. The other kami eventually succeeded in coaxing her out. Susanoo was then banished to earth, where he married and had children. According to the Kojiki, Amaterasu then sent her grandson, Ninigi, to rule Japan, giving him curved beads, a mirror, and a sword: the symbols of Japanese imperial authority. Amaterasu remains probably Japan\\'s most venerated kami.\\n\\n\\n=== Cosmology and afterlife ===\\nIn Shinto, the creative principle permeating all life is known as musubi, and is associated with its own kami. Within traditional Japanese thought, there is no concept of an overarching duality between good and evil. The concept of aki encompasses misfortune, unhappiness, and disaster, although does not correspond precisely with the Western concept of evil. There is no eschatology in Shinto. \\nTexts such as the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki portray multiple realms in Shinto cosmology. These present a universe divided into three parts: the Plain of High Heaven (Takama-no-hara), where the kami live; the Phenomenal or Manifested World (Utsushi-yo), where humans dwell; and the Nether World (Yomotsu-kuni), where unclean spirits reside. The mythological texts nevertheless do not draw firm demarcations between these realms.Shinto includes belief in a human spirit or soul, called the mitama or tamashii, which contains four aspects. Although indigenous ideas about an afterlife were probably well-developed prior to the arrival of Buddhism, contemporary Japanese people often adopt Buddhist concepts about an afterlife. Modern Shinto places greater emphasis on this life than on any afterlife. Mythological stories like the Kojiki describe yomi or yomi-no-kuni as a realm of the dead, although this plays no role in modern Shinto. Modern Shinto ideas about the afterlife largely revolve around the idea that the spirit survives bodily death and continues to assist the living. After 33 years, it then becomes part of the family kami. These ancestral spirits are sometimes thought to reside in the mountains, from where they descend to take part in agricultural events. Shinto\\'s afterlife beliefs also include the obake, restless spirits who died in bad circumstances and often seek revenge.\\n\\n\\n=== Purity and impurity ===\\nA key theme in Shinto is the avoidance of kegare (\"pollution\" or \"impurity\"), while ensuring harae (\"purity\"). In Japanese thought, humans are seen as fundamentally pure. Kegare is therefore seen as being a temporary condition that can be corrected through achieving harae. Rites of purification are conducted so as to restore an individual to \"spiritual\" health and render them useful to society.\\n\\nThis notion of purity is present in many facets of Japanese culture, such as the focus it places on bathing. Purification is for instance regarded as important in preparation for the planting season, while performers of noh theatre undergo a purification rite before they carry out their performances. Among the things regarded as particular pollutants in Shinto are death, disease, witchcraft, the flaying alive of an animal, incest, bestiality, excrement, and blood associated with either menstruation or childbirth. To avoid kegare, priests and other practitioners may engage in abstinence and avoid various activities prior to a festival or ritual.\\nVarious words, termed imi-kotoba, are also regarded as taboo, and people avoid speaking them when at a shrine; these include shi (death), byō (illness), and shishi (meat).A purification ceremony known as misogi involves the use of fresh water, salt water, or salt to remove kegare. Full immersion in the sea is often regarded as the most ancient and efficacious form of purification. This act links with the mythological tale in which Izanagi immersed himself in the sea to purify himself after discovering his deceased wife; it was from this act that other kami sprang from his body. An alternative is immersion beneath a waterfall. Salt is often regarded as a purifying substance; some Shinto practitioners will for instance sprinkle salt on themselves after a funeral, while those running restaurants may put a small pile of salt outside before business commences each day. Fire, also, is perceived as a source of purification. The yaku-barai is a form of harae designed to prevent misfortune, while the oharae, or \"ceremony of great purification\", is often used for end-of-year purification rites, and is conducted twice a year at many shrines. Before the Meiji period, rites of purification were generally performed by onmyōji, a type of diviner whose practices derived from the Chinese yin and yang philosophy. \\n\\n\\n=== Kannagara, morality, and ethics ===\\nIn Shinto, kannagara (\"way of the kami\") describes the law of the natural order, with wa (\"benign harmony\") being inherent in all things. Disrupting wa is deemed bad, contributing to it is thought good; as such, subordination of the individual to the larger social unit has long been a characteristic of the religion. Shinto incorporates morality tales and myths but no overarching, codified ethical doctrine; Offner noted that Shinto specified no \"unified, systematized code of behaviour\". Its views of kannagara influence certain ethical views, focused on sincerity (makoto) and honesty (tadashii). Makoto is regarded as a cardinal virtue in Japanese religion more broadly. Shinto sometimes includes reference to four virtues known as the akaki kiyoki kokoro or sei-mei-shin, meaning \"purity and cheerfulness of heart\", which are linked to the state of harae. Offner believed that in Shinto, ideas about goodness linked to \"that which possesses, or relates to, beauty, brightness, excellence, good fortune, nobility, purity, suitability, harmony, conformity, [and] productivity.\" Shojiki is regarded as a virtue, encompassing honesty, uprightness, veracity, and frankness. Shinto\\'s flexibility regarding morality and ethics has been a source of frequent criticism, especially from those arguing that the religion can readily become a pawn for those wishing to use it to legitimise their authority and power.Throughout Japanese history, the notion of saisei-itchi, or the union of religious authority and political authority, has long been prominent.\\nCali and Dougill noted that Shinto had long been associated with \"an insular and protective view\" of Japanese society. They added that in the modern world, Shinto tends toward conservatism and nationalism. In the late 1990s, Bocking noted that \"an apparently regressive nationalism still seems the natural ally of some central elements\" of Shinto. As a result of these associations, Shinto is still viewed suspiciously by various civil liberties groups in Japan and by many of Japan\\'s neighbors.\\n\\nShinto priests may face various ethical conundrums. In the 1980s, for instance, the priests at the Suwa Shrine in Nagasaki debated whether to invite the crew of a U.S. Navy vessel docked at the port city to their festival celebrations given the sensitivities surrounding the 1945 U.S. use of the atomic bomb on the city. In other cases, priests have opposed construction projects on shrine-owned land, sometimes putting them at odds with other interest groups. At Kaminoseki in the early 2000s, a priest opposed the sale of shrine lands to build a nuclear power plant; he was eventually pressured to resign over the issue. Another issue of considerable debate has been the activities of the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The shrine is devoted to Japan\\'s war dead, and in 1979 it enshrined 14 men, including Hideki Tojo, who had been declared Class-A defendants at the 1946 Tokyo War Crimes Trials. This generated both domestic and international condemnation, particularly from China and Korea.In the 21st century, Shinto has increasingly been portrayed as a nature-centred spirituality with environmentalist credentials. Shinto shrines have increasingly emphasised the preservation of the forests surrounding many of them, and several shrines have collaborated with local environmentalist campaigns. In 2014, an international interreligious conference on environmental sustainability was held at the Ise shrine, attended by United Nations representatives and around 700 Shinto priests. Critical commentators have characterised the presentation of Shinto as an environmentalist movement as a rhetorical ploy rather than a concerted effort by Shinto institutions to become environmentally sustainable. The scholar Aike P. Rots suggested that the repositioning of Shinto as a \"nature religion\" may have grown in popularity as a means of disassociating the religion from controversial issues \"related to war memory and imperial patronage.\"\\n\\n\\n== Practice ==\\nShinto tends to focus on ritual behavior rather than doctrine. The philosophers James W. Boyd and Ron G. Williams stated that Shinto is \"first and foremost a ritual tradition\", while Picken observed that \"Shinto is interested not in credenda but in agenda, not in things that should be believed but in things that should be done.\" The scholar of religion Clark B. Offner stated that Shinto\\'s focus was on \"maintaining communal, ceremonial traditions for the purpose of human (communal) well-being\".\\nIt is often difficult to distinguish Shinto practices from Japanese customs more broadly, with Picken observing that the \"worldview of Shinto\" provided the \"principal source of self-understanding within the Japanese way of life\". Nelson stated that \"Shinto-based orientations and values[…] lie at the core of Japanese culture, society, and character\".\\n\\n\\n=== Shrines ===\\n\\nPublic spaces in which the kami are worshipped are often known under the generic term jinja (\"kami-place\"); this term applies to the location rather than to a specific building. Jinja is usually translated as \"shrine\" in English, although in earlier literature was sometimes translated as \"temple\", a term now more commonly reserved for Japan\\'s Buddhist structures. There are around 100,000 public shrines in Japan; about 80,000 are affiliated with the Association of Shinto Shrines, with another 20,000 being unaffiliated. They are found all over the country, from isolated rural areas to dense metropolitan ones. More specific terms are sometimes used for certain shrines depending on their function; some of the grand shrines with imperial associations are termed jingū, those devoted to the war dead are termed shokonsha, and those linked to mountains deemed to be inhabited by kami are yama-miya.Jinja typically consist of complexes of multiple buildings, with the architectural styles of shrines having largely developed by the Heian period. The inner sanctuary in which the kami lives is the honden. Inside the honden may be stored material belonging to the kami; known as shinpo, this can include artworks, clothing, weapons, musical instruments, bells, and mirrors. Typically, worshippers carry out their acts outside of the honden. Near the honden can sometimes be found a subsidiary shrine, the bekkū, to another kami; the kami inhabiting this shrine is not necessarily perceived as being inferior to that in the honden. At some places, halls of worship have been erected, termed haiden. On a lower level can be found the hall of offerings, known as a heiden. Together, the building housing the honden, haiden, and heiden is called a hongū. In some shrines, there is a separate building in which to conduct additional ceremonies, such as weddings, known as a gishikiden, or a specific building in which the kagura dance is performed, known as the kagura-den. Collectively, the central buildings of a shrine are known as the shaden, while its precincts are known as the keidaichi or shin\\'en. This precinct is surrounded by the tamagaki fence, with entry via a shinmon gate, which can be closed at night.\\n\\nShrine entrances are marked by a two-post gateway with either one or two crossbeams atop it, known as torii. The exact details of these torii varies and there are at least twenty different styles. These are regarded as demarcating the area where the kami resides; passing under them is often viewed as a form of purification. More broadly, torii are internationally recognised symbols of Japan. Their architectural form is distinctly Japanese, although the decision to paint most of them in vermillion reflects a Chinese influence dating from the Nara period. Also set at the entrances to many shrines are komainu, statues of lion or dog like animals perceived to scare off malevolent spirits; typically these will come as a pair, one with its mouth open, the other with its mouth closed.Shrines are often set within gardens or wooded groves called chinju no mori (\"forest of the tutelary kami\"), which vary in size from just a few trees to sizeable areas of woodland. Large lanterns, known as tōrō, are often found within these precincts. Shrines often have an office, known as a shamusho, a saikan where priests undergo forms of abstinence and purification prior to conducting rituals, and other buildings such as a priests\\' quarters and a storehouse. Various kiosks often sell amulets to visitors. Since the late 1940s, shrines have had to be financially self-sufficient, relying on the donations of worshippers and visitors. These funds are used to pay the wages of the priests, to finance the upkeep of the buildings, to cover the shrine\\'s membership fees of various regional and national Shinto groups, and to contribute to disaster relief funds.In Shinto, it is seen as important that the places in which kami are venerated be kept clean and not neglected. Through to the Edo period, it was common for kami shrines to be demolished and rebuilt at a nearby location in order to remove any pollutants and ensure purity. This has continued into recent times at certain sites, such as the Ise Grand Shrine, which is moved to an adjacent site every two decades. Separate shrines can also be merged in a process known as jinja gappei, while the act of transferring the kami from one building to another is called sengu. Shrines may have legends about their foundation, which are known as en-gi. These sometimes also record miracles associated with the shrine. From the Heian period on, the en-gi were often retold on picture scrolls known as emakimono.\\n\\n\\n==== Priesthood and miko ====\\n\\nShrines may be cared for by priests, by local communities, or by families on whose property the shrine is found. Shinto priests are known in Japanese as kannushi, meaning \"proprietor of kami\", or alternatively as shinshoku or shinkan. Many kannushi take on the role in a line of hereditary succession traced down specific families. In contemporary Japan, there are two main training universities for those wishing to become kannushi, at Kokugakuin University in Tokyo and at Kogakkan University in Mie Prefecture. Priests can rise through the ranks over the course of their careers. The number of priests at a particular shrine can vary; some shrines can have dozens, and others have none, instead being administered by local lay volunteers. Some priests administer to multiple small shrines, sometimes over ten.Priestly costume is largely based on the clothes worn at the imperial court during the Heian period. It includes a tall, rounded hat known as an eboshi, and black lacquered wooden clogs known as asagutsu. The outer garment worn by a priest, usually colored black, red, or light blue, is the hō, or the ikan. A white silk version of the ikan, used for formal occasions, is known as the saifuku. Another priestly robe is the kariginu, which is modelled on Heian-style hunting garments. Also part of standard priestly attire is a hiōgi fan, while during rituals, priests carry a flat piece of wood known as a shaku. This costume is generally more ornate than the sombre garments worn by Japanese Buddhist monks.\\n\\nThe chief priest at a shrine is the gūji. Larger shrines may also have an assistant head priest, the gon-gūji. As with teachers, instructors, and Buddhist clergy, Shinto priests are often referred to as sensei by lay practitioners. Historically, there were female priests although they were largely pushed out of their positions in 1868. During the Second World War, women were again allowed to become priests to fill the void caused by large numbers of men being enlisted in the military. By the late 1990s, around 90% of priests were male, 10% female. Priests are free to marry and have children.  At smaller shrines, priests often have other full-time jobs, and serve only as priests during special occasions.\\nBefore certain major festivals, priests may undergo a period of abstinence from sexual relations. Some of those involved in festivals also abstain from a range of other things, such as consuming tea, coffee, or alcohol, immediately prior to the events.The priests are assisted by jinja miko, sometimes referred to as \"shrine-maidens\" in English. These miko are typically unmarried, although not necessarily virgins. In many cases they are the daughters of a priest or a practitioner. They are subordinate to the priests in the shrine hierarchy. Their most important role is in the kagura dance, known as otome-mai. Miko receive only a small salary but gain respect from members of the local community and learn skills such as cooking, calligraphy, painting, and etiquette which can benefit them when later searching for employment or a marriage partner. They generally do not live at the shrines. Sometimes they fill other roles, such as being secretaries in the shrine offices or clerks at the information desks, or as waitresses at the naorai feasts. They also assist kannushi in ceremonial rites.\\n\\n\\n==== Visits to shrines ====\\nVisits to the shrine are termed sankei, or jinja mairi. Some individuals visit the shrines daily, often on their morning route to work; they typically take only a few minutes. Usually, a worshipper will approach the honden, placing a monetary offering in a box and then ringing a bell to call the kami\\'s attention. Then, they bow, clap, and stand while silently offering a prayer. The clapping is known as kashiwade or hakushu; the prayers or supplications as kigan. This individual worship is known as hairei. More broadly, ritual prayers to the kami are called norito, while the coins offered are saisen. At the shrine, individuals offering prayers are not necessarily praying to a specific kami. A worshipper may not know the name of a kami residing at the shrine nor how many kami are believed to dwell there. Unlike in certain other religions, Shinto shrines do not have weekly services that practitioners are expected to attend.\\n\\nSome Shinto practitioners do not offer their prayers to the kami directly, but rather request that a priest offer them on their behalf; these prayers are known as kitō. Many individuals approach the kami asking for pragmatic requests. Requests for rain, known as amagoi (\"rain-soliciting\") have been found across Japan, with Inari a popular choice for such requests.\\nOther prayers reflect more contemporary concerns. For instance, people may ask that the priest approaches the kami so as to purify their car in the hope that this will prevent it from being involved in an accident. Similarly, transport companies often request purification rites for new buses or airplanes which are about to go into service. Before a building is constructed, it is common for either private individuals or the construction company to employ a Shinto priest to come to the land being developed and perform the jichinsai, or earth sanctification ritual. This purifies the site and asks the kami to bless it.People often ask the kami to help offset inauspicious events that may affect them. For instance, in Japanese culture, the age 33 is seen as being unlucky for women and the age 42 for men, and thus people can ask the kami to offset any ill-fortune associated with being this age. Certain directions can also be seen as being inauspicious for certain people at certain times and thus people can approach the kami asking them to offset this problem if they have to travel in one of these unlucky directions.Pilgrimage has long been important in Japanese religion, with pilgrimages to Shinto shrines called junrei. A round of pilgrimages, whereby individuals visit a series of shrines and other sacred sites that are part of an established circuit, is known as a junpai. An individual leading these pilgrims, is sometimes termed a sendatsu. For many centuries, people have also visited the shrines for primarily cultural and recreational reasons, as opposed to spiritual ones. Many of the shrines are recognised as sites of historical importance and some are classified as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Shrines such as Shimogamo Jinja and Fushimi Inari Taisha in Kyoto, Meiji Jingū in Tokyo, and Atsuta Jingū in Nagoya are among Japan\\'s most popular tourist sites. Many shrines have a unique rubber-stamp seal which visitors can get printed into their sutanpu bukku or stamp book, demonstrating the different shrines they have visited.\\n\\n\\n=== Harae and hōbei ===\\n\\nShinto rituals begin with a process of purification, or harae. Using fresh water or salt water, this is known as misogi. At shrines, this entails sprinkling this water onto the face and hands, a procedure known as temizu, using a font known as a temizuya. Another form of purification at the start of a Shinto rite entails waving a white paper streamer or wand known as the haraigushi. When not in use, the haraigushi is usually kept in a stand. The priest waves the haraigushi horizontally over a person or object being purified in a movement known as sa-yu-sa (\"left-right-left\"). Sometimes, instead of a haraigushi, the purification is carried out with an o-nusa, a branch of evergreen to which strips of paper have been attached. The waving of the haraigushi is often followed by an additional act of purification, the shubatsu, in which the priest sprinkles water, salt, or brine over those assembled from a wooden box called the \\'en-to-oke or magemono.The acts of purification accomplished, petitions known as norito are spoken to the kami. This is followed by an appearance by the miko, who commence in a slow circular motion before the main altar. Offerings are then presented to the kami by being placed on a table. This act is known as hōbei; the offerings themselves as saimotsu or sonae-mono. Historically, the offerings given the kami included food, cloth, swords, and horses. In the contemporary period, lay worshippers usually give gifts of money to the kami while priests generally offer them food, drink, and sprigs of the sacred sakaki tree. Animal sacrifices are not considered appropriate offerings, as the shedding of blood is seen as a polluting act that necessitates purification. The offerings presented are sometimes simple and sometimes more elaborate; at the Grand Shrine of Ise, for instance, 100 styles of food are laid out as offerings. The choice of offerings will often be tailored to the specific kami and occasion.Offerings of food and drink are specifically termed shinsen.Sake, or rice wine, is a very common offering to the kami. After the offerings have been given, people often sip rice wine known as o-miki. Drinking the o-miki wine is seen as a form of communion with the kami. On important occasions, a feast is then held, known as naorai, inside a banquet hall attached to the shrine complex.The kami are believed to enjoy music. One style of music performed at shrines is gagaku. Instruments used include three reeds (fue, sho, and hichiriki), the yamato-koto, and the \"three drums\" (taiko, kakko, and shōko). Other musical styles performed at shrines can have a more limited focus. At shrines such as Ōharano Shrine in Kyoto, azuma-asobi (\"eastern entertainment\") music is performed on April 8. Also in Kyoto, various festivals make use of the dengaku style of music and dance, which originated from rice-planting songs. During rituals, people visiting the shrine are expected to sit in the seiza style, with their legs tucked beneath their bottom. To avoid cramps, individuals who hold this position for a lengthy period of time may periodically move their legs and flex their heels.\\n\\n\\n=== Home shrines ===\\n\\nHaving seen their popularity increase in the Meiji era, many Shinto practitioners also have a family shrine, or kamidana (\"kami shelf\"), in their home. These usually consist of shelves placed at an elevated position in the living room. Kamidana can also be found in workplaces, restaurants, shops, and ocean-going ships. Some public shrines sell entire kamidana.Along with the kamidana, many Japanese households also have butsudan, Buddhist altars enshrining the ancestors of the family; ancestral reverence remains an important aspect of Japanese religious tradition. In the rare instances where Japanese individuals are given a Shinto funeral rather than a Buddhist one, a tama-ya, mitama-ya, or sorei-sha shrine may be erected in the home in place of a butsudan. This will be typically placed below the kamidana and include symbols of the resident ancestral spirit, for instance a mirror or a scroll.Kamidana often enshrine the kami of a nearby public shrine as well as a tutelary kami associated with the house\\'s occupants or their profession. They can be decorated with miniature torii and shimenawa and include amulets obtained from public shrines. They often contain a stand on which to place offerings; daily offerings of rice, salt, and water are placed there, with sake and other items also offered on special days. These domestic rituals often take place early in the morning, and prior to conducting them, practitioners often bathe, rinse their mouth, or wash their hands as a form of purification.Household Shinto can focus attention on the dōzoku-shin, kami who are perceived to be ancestral to the dōzoku or extended kinship group. A small shrine for the ancestors of a household are known as soreisha. Small village shrines containing the tutelary kami of an extended family are known as iwai-den. In addition to the temple shrines and the household shrines, Shinto also features small wayside shrines known as hokora. Other open spaces used for the worship of kami are iwasaka, an area surrounded by sacred rocks.\\n\\n\\n=== Engimono, Ema, divination, and amulets ===\\n\\nA common feature of Shinto shrines is the provision of ema, small wooden plaques onto which practitioners will write a wish or desire that they would like to see fulfilled. The practitioner\\'s message is written on one side of the plaque, while on the other is usually a printed picture or pattern related to the shrine itself. Ema are provided both at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples in Japan; unlike most amulets, which are taken away from the shrine, the ema are typically left there as a message for the resident kami. Those administering the shrine will then often burn all of the collected ema at new year.Divination is the focus of many Shinto rituals, with various forms of divination used by its practitioners, some introduced from China. Among the ancient forms of divination found in Japan are rokuboku and kiboku. Several forms of divination entailing archery are also practiced in Shintō, known as yabusame, omato-shinji, and mato-i. Kitagawa stated that there could be \"no doubt\" that various types of \"shamanic diviners\" played a role in early Japanese religion. A form of divination previously common in Japan was bokusen or uranai, which often used tortoise shells; it is still used in some places.A form of divination that is popular at Shinto shrines are the omikuji. These are small slips of paper which are obtained from the shrine (for a donation) and which are then read to reveal a prediction for the future. Those who receive a bad prediction often then tie the omikuji to a nearby tree or frame set up for the purpose. This act is seen as rejecting the prediction, a process called sute-mikuji, and thus avoiding the misfortune it predicted.\\n\\nThe use of amulets are widely sanctioned and popular in Japan. These may be made of paper, wood, cloth, metal, or plastic.Ofuda act as amulets to keep off misfortune and also serve as talismans to bring benefits and good luck. They typically comprise a tapering piece of wood onto which the name of the shrine and its enshrined kami are written or printed. The ofuda is then wrapped inside white paper and tied up with a colored thread. Ofuda are provided both at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. Another type of amulet provided at shrines and temples are the omamori, which are traditionally small, brightly colored drawstring bags with the name of the shrine written on it. Omamori and ofuda are sometimes placed within a charm bag known as a kinchaku, typically worn by small children.At new year, many shrines sell hamaya (an \"evil-destroying arrows\"), which people can purchase and keep in their home over the coming year to bring good luck.\\nA daruma is a round, paper doll of the Indian monk, Bodhidharma. The recipient makes a wish and paints one eye; when the goal is accomplished, the recipient paints the other eye. While this is a Buddhist practice, darumas can be found at shrines, as well. These dolls are very common.\\nOther protective items include dorei, which are earthenware bells that are used to pray for good fortune. These bells are usually in the shapes of the zodiacal animals. Inuhariko are paper dogs that are used to induce and to bless good births. Collectively, these talismans through which home to manipulate events and influence spirits, as well as related mantras and rites for the same purpose, are known as majinai.\\n\\n\\n=== Kagura ===\\n\\nKagura describes the music and dance performed for the kami; the term may have originally derived from  kami no kura (\"seat of the kami\"). Throughout Japanese history, dance has played an important culture role and in Shinto it is regarded as having the capacity to pacify kami. There is a mythological tale of how kagura dance came into existence. According to the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki, Ame-no-Uzume performed a dance to entice Amaterasu out of the cave in which she had hidden herself.There are two broad types of kagura. One is Imperial kagura, also known as mikagura. This style was developed in the imperial court and is still performed on imperial grounds every December. It is also performed at the Imperial harvest festival and at major shrines such as Ise, Kamo, and Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū. It is performed by singers and musicians using shakubyoshi wooden clappers, a hichiriki, a kagura-bue flute, and a six-stringed zither. The other main type is sato-kagura, descended from mikagura and performed at shrines across Japan. Depending on the style, it is performed by miko or by actors wearing masks to portray various mythological figures. These actors are accompanied by a hayashi band using flutes and drums. There are also other, regional types of kagura.Music plays a very important role in the kagura performance. Everything from the setup of the instruments to the most subtle sounds and the arrangement of the music is crucial to encouraging the kami to come down and dance. The songs are used as magical devices to summon the kami and as prayers for blessings. Rhythm patterns of five and seven are common, possibly relating to the Shinto belief of the twelve generations of heavenly and earthly deities. There is also vocal accompaniment called kami uta in which the drummer sings sacred songs to the kami. Often the vocal accompaniment is overshadowed by the drumming and instruments, reinforcing that the vocal aspect of the music is more for incantation rather than aesthetics.\\n\\n\\n=== Festivals ===\\n\\nPublic festivals are commonly termed matsuri, although this term has varied meanings—\"festival,\" \"worship,\" \"celebration,\" \"rite,\" or \"prayer\"—and no direct translation into English. Picken suggested that the festival was \"the central act of Shinto worship\" because Shinto was a \"community- and family-based\" religion. Most mark the seasons of the agricultural year and involve offerings being directed to the kami in thanks. According to a traditional lunar calendar, Shinto shrines should hold their festival celebrations on hare-no-hi or \"clear\" days\", the days of the new, full, and half moons. Other days, known as ke-no-hi, were generally avoided for festivities. However, since the late 20th century, many shrines have held their festival celebrations on the Saturday or Sunday closest to the date so that fewer individuals will be working and will be able to attend. Each town or village often has its own festival, centred on a local shrine. For instance, the Aoi Matsuri festival, held on 15 May to pray for an abundant grain harvest, takes place at shrines in Kyoto, while the Chichibu Yo-Matsuri takes place on 2–3 December in Chichibu.Spring festivals are called haru-matsuri and often incorporate prayers for a good harvest. They sometimes involve ta-asobi ceremonies, in which rice is ritually planted. Summer festivals are termed natsu-matsuri and are usually focused on protecting the crops against pests and other threats. Autumn festivals are known as aki-matsuri and primarily focus on thanking the kami for the rice or other harvest. The Niiname-sai, or festival of new rice, is held across many Shinto shrines on 23 November. The emperor also conducts a ceremony to mark this festival, at which he presents the first fruits of the harvest to the kami at midnight. Winter festivals, called fuyu no matsuri often feature on welcoming in the spring, expelling evil, and calling in good influences for the future. There is little difference between winter festivals and specific new year festivals.\\n\\nThe season of the new year is called shogatsu. On the last day of the year (31 December), omisoka, practitioners usually clean their household shrines in preparation for New Year\\'s Day (1 January), ganjitsu. Many people visit public shrines to celebrate new year; this \"first visit\" of the year is known as hatsumōde or hatsumairi. There, they buy amulets and talismans to bring them good fortune over the coming year. To celebrate this festival, many Japanese put up rope known as shimenawa on their homes and places of business. Some also put up kadomatsu (\"gateway pine\"), an arrangement of pine branches, plum tree, and bamboo sticks. Also displayed are kazari, which are smaller and more colourful; their purpose is to keep away misfortune and attract good fortune. In many places, new year celebrations incorporate hadaka matsuri (\"naked festivals\") in which men dressed only in a fundoshi loincloth engage in a particular activity, such as fighting over a specific object or immersing themselves in a river.A common feature of festivals are processions or parades known as gyōretsu. These can be raucous, with many participants being drunk; Breen and Teeuwen characterised them as having a \"carnivalesque atmosphere\". They are often understood as having a regenerative effect on both the participants and the community. During these processions, the kami travel in portable shrines known as mikoshi. In various cases the mikoshi undergo hamaori (\"going down to the beach\"), a process by which they are carried to the sea shore and sometimes into the sea, either by bearers or a boat. For instance, in the Okunchi festival held in the southwestern city of Nagasaki, the kami of the Suwa Shrine are paraded down to Ohato, where they are placed in a shrine there for several days before being paraded back to Suwa. These sort of celebrations are often organized largely by members of the local community rather than by the priests themselves.\\n\\n\\n=== Rites of passage ===\\nThe formal recognition of events is given great importance in Japanese culture. A common ritual, the hatsumiyamairi, entails a child\\'s first visit to a Shinto shrine. A tradition holds that, if a boy he should be brought to the shrine on the thirty-second day after birth, and if a girl she should be brought on the thirty-third day. Historically, the child was commonly brought to the shrine not by the mother, who was considered impure after birth, but by another female relative; since the late 20th century it has been more common for the mother to do so. Another rite of passage, the saiten-sai or seijin shiki, is a coming of age ritual marking the transition to adulthood and occurs when an individual is around twenty. Wedding ceremonies are often carried out at Shinto shrines. These are called shinzen kekkon (\"a wedding before the kami\") and were popularised in the Meiji period; prior to this, weddings were commonly performed in the home.In Japan, funerals tend to take place at Buddhist temples and involve cremation, with Shinto funerals being rare. Bocking noted that most Japanese people are \"still \\'born Shinto\\' yet \\'die Buddhist\\'.\" In Shinto thought, contact with death is seen as imparting impurity (kegare); the period following this contact is known as kibuku and is associated with various taboos. In cases when dead humans are enshrined as kami, the physical remains of the dead are not stored at the shrine. Although not common, there have been examples of funerals conducted through Shinto rites. The earliest examples are known from the mid-17th century; these occurred in certain areas of Japan and had the support of the local authorities.\\nFollowing the Meiji Restoration, in 1868 the government recognised specifically Shinto funerals for Shinto priests. Five years later, this was extended to cover the entire Japanese population. Despite this Meiji promotion of Shinto funerals, the majority of the population continued to have Buddhist funeral rites. In recent decades, Shinto funerals have usually been reserved for Shinto priests and for members of certain Shinto sects. After cremation, the normal funerary process in Japan, the ashes of a priest may be interred near to the shrine, but not inside its precincts.Ancestral reverence remains an important part of Japanese religious custom. The invocation of the dead, and especially the war dead, is known as shо̄kon. Various rites reference this. For instance, at the largely Buddhist festival of Bon, the souls of the ancestors are believed to visit the living, and are then sent away in a ritual called shо̄rо̄ nagashi, by which lanterns are inserted into small boats, often made of paper, and placed in a river to float downstream.\\n\\n\\n=== Spirit mediumship and healing ===\\n\\nShinto practitioners believe that the kami can possess a human being and then speak through them, a process known as kami-gakari. Several new religious movements drawing upon Shinto, such as Tenrikyo and Oomoto, were founded by individuals claiming to be guided by a possessing kami. The takusen is an oracle that is passed from the kami via the medium.The itako and ichiko are blind women who train to become spiritual mediums, traditionally in Japan\\'s northern Tohoku region. Itako train under other itako from childhood, memorialising sacred texts and prayers, fasting, and undertaking acts of severe asceticism, through which they are believed to cultivate supernatural powers. In an initiation ceremony, a kami is believed to possess the young woman, and the two are then ritually \"married\". After this, the kami becomes her tutelary spirit and she will henceforth be able to call upon it, and a range of other spirits, in future. Through contacting these spirits, she is able to convey their messages to the living. Itako usually carry out their rituals independent of the shrine system. Japanese culture also includes spiritual healers known as ogamiya-san whose work involves invoking both kami and Buddhas.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early development ===\\n\\nEarhart commented that Shinto ultimately \"emerged from the beliefs and practices of prehistoric Japan\", although Kitagawa noted that it was questionable whether prehistoric Japanese religions could be accurately termed \"early Shinto\". It was the Yayoi period of Japanese prehistory which first left traces of material and iconography prefiguring that later included in Shinto. Kami were worshipped at various landscape features during this period; at this point, their worship consisted largely of beseeching and placating them, with little evidence that they were viewed as compassionate entities. Archaeological evidence suggests that dotaku bronze bells, bronze weapons, and metal mirrors played an important role in kami-based ritual during the Yayoi period.In this early period, Japan was not a unified state; by the Kofun period it was divided among Uji (clans), each with their own tutelary kami, the ujigami. Korean migration during the Kofun period brought Confucianism and Buddhism to Japan. Buddhism had a particular impact on the kami cults. Migrant groups and Japanese who increasingly aligned with these foreign influences built Buddhist temples in various parts of the Japanese islands. Several rival clans who were more hostile to these foreign influences began adapting the shrines of their kami to more closely resemble the new Buddhist structures. In the late 5th century, the Yamato clan leader Yūryaku declared himself daiō (\"great king\") and established hegemony over much of Japan. From the early 6th century CE, the style of ritual favored by the Yamato began spreading to other kami shrines around Japan as the Yamato extended their territorial influence. Buddhism was also growing. According to the Nihon Shoki, in 587 Emperor Yōmei converted to Buddhism and under his sponsorship Buddhism spread.\\n\\nIn the mid-7th century, a legal code called Ritsuryō was adopted to establish a Chinese-style centralised government. As part of this, the Jingikan (\"Council of Kami\") was created to conduct rites of state and coordinate provincial ritual with that in the capital. This was done according to a code of kami law called the Jingiryō, itself modelled on the Chinese Book of Rites. The Jingikan was located in the palace precincts and maintained a register of shrines and priests. An annual calendar of state rites were introduced to help unify Japan through kami worship. These legally mandated rites were outlined in the Yōrō Code of 718, and expanded in the Jogan Gishiki of circa 872 and the Engi Shiki of 927. Under the Jingikan, some shrines were designated as kansha (\"official shrines\") and given specific privileges and responsibilities. Hardacre saw the Jingikan as \"the institutional origin of Shinto\".In the early 8th century, the Emperor Tenmu commissioned a compilation of the legends and genealogies of Japan\\'s clans, resulting in the completion of the Kojiki in 712. Designed to legitimate the ruling dynasty, this text created a fixed version of various stories previously circulating in oral tradition. The Kojiki omits any reference to Buddhism, in part because it sought to ignore foreign influences and emphasise a narrative stressing indigenous elements of Japanese culture. Several years later, the Nihon shoki was written. Unlike the Kojiki, this made various references to Buddhism, and was aimed at a foreign audience. Both of these texts sought to establish the imperial clan\\'s descent from the sun kami Amaterasu, although there were many differences in the cosmogonic narrative they provided. Quickly, the Nihon shoki eclipsed the Kojiki in terms of its influence. Other texts written at this time also drew on oral traditions regarding the kami. The Sendari kuji hongi for example was probably composed by the Mononobe clan while the Kogoshui was probably put together for the Imibe clan, and in both cases they were designed to highlight the divine origins of these respective lineages. A government order in 713 called on each region to produce fudoki, records of local geography, products, and stories, with the latter revealing more traditions about the kami which were present at this time.From the 8th century, kami worship and Buddhism were thoroughly intertwined in Japanese society. While the emperor and court performed Buddhist rites, they also performed others to honor the kami. Tenmu for example appointed a virginal imperial princess to serve as the saiō, a form of priestess, at the Ise Shrine on his behalf, a tradition continued by subsequent emperors. From the 8th century onward up until the Meiji era, the kami were incorporated into a Buddhist cosmology in various ways. One view is that the kami realised that like all other life-forms, they too were trapped in the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and that to escape this they had to follow Buddhist teachings. Alternative approaches viewed the kami as benevolent entities who protected Buddhism, or that the kami were themselves Buddhas, or beings who had achieved enlightenment. In this, they could be either hongaku, the pure spirits of the Buddhas, or honji suijaku, transformations of the Buddhas in their attempt to help all sentient beings.\\n\\n\\n=== Nara period ===\\nThis period hosted many changes to the country, government, and religion. The capital is moved again to Heijō-kyō (modern-day Nara), in AD 710 by Empress Genmei due to the death of the emperor. This practice was necessary due to the Shinto belief in the impurity of death and the need to avoid this pollution. However, this practice of moving the capital due to \"death impurity\" is then abolished by the Taihō Code and rise in Buddhist influence. The establishment of the imperial city in partnership with Taihō Code is important to Shinto as the office of the Shinto rites becomes more powerful in assimilating local clan shrines into the imperial fold. New shrines are built and assimilated each time the city is moved. All of the grand shrines are regulated under Taihō and are required to account for incomes, priests, and practices due to their national contributions.\\n\\n\\n=== Meiji era and the Empire of Japan ===\\n\\nBreen and Teeuwen characterise the period between 1868 and 1915, during the Meiji era, as being the \"formative years\" of modern Shinto. It is in this period that various scholars have argued that Shinto was essentially \"invented\".\\nFridell argues that scholars call the period from 1868 to 1945 the \"State Shinto period\" because, \"during these decades, Shinto elements came under a great deal of overt state influence and control as the Japanese government systematically utilized shrine worship as a major force for mobilizing imperial loyalties on behalf of modern nation-building.\" However, the government had already been treating shrines as an extension of government before Meiji; see for example the Tenpō Reforms. Moreover, according to the scholar Jason Ānanda Josephson, It is inaccurate to describe shrines as constituting a \"state religion\" or a \"theocracy\" during this period since they had neither organization, nor doctrine, and were uninterested in conversion.The Meiji Restoration of 1868 was fuelled by a renewal of Confucian ethics and imperial patriotism among Japan\\'s ruling class. Among these reformers, Buddhism was seen as a corrupting influence that had undermined what they envisioned as Japan\\'s original purity and greatness. They wanted to place a renewed emphasis on kami worship as an indigenous form of ritual, an attitude that was also fuelled by anxieties about Western expansionism and fear that Christianity would take hold in Japan.1868, all shrine priests were placed under the authority of the new Jingikan, or Council of Kami Affairs. A project of forcible separating kami worship from Buddhism as implemented, with Buddhist monks, deities, buildings, and rituals being banned from kami shrines. Buddhist imagery, scriptures, and ritual equipment were burnt, covered in excrement, or otherwise destroyed. In 1871, a new hierarchy of shrines was introduced, with imperial and national shrines at the top. Hereditary priesthoods were abolished and a new state-sanctioned system for appointing priests was introduced.\\nIn 1872, the Jingikan was closed and replaced with the Kyobusho, or Ministry of Edification. This coordinated a campaign whereby kyodoshoku (\"national evangelists\") were sent through the country to promote Japan\\'s \"Great Teaching,\" which included respect for the kami and obedience to the emperor. This campaign was discontinued in 1884. In 1906, thousands of village shrines were merged so that most small communities had only a single shrine, where rites in honor of the emperor could be held. Shinto effectively became the state cult, one promoted with growing zeal in the build-up to the Second World War.In 1882, the Meiji government designated 13 religious movements that were neither Buddhist nor Christian to be forms of \"Sect Shinto\". The number and name of the sects given this formal designation varied; often they merged ideas with Shinto from Buddhism, Christian, Confucian, Daoist, and Western esoteric traditions. In the Meiji period, many local traditions died out and were replaced by nationally standardised practices encouraged from Tokyo.Although the government sponsorship of shrines declined, Japanese nationalism remained closely linked to the legends of foundation and emperors, as developed by the kokugaku scholars. In 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to \"offer yourselves courageously to the State\" as well as to protect the Imperial family. Such processes continued to deepen throughout the early Shōwa era, coming to an abrupt end in August 1945 when Japan lost the war in the Pacific. On 1 January 1946, Emperor Shōwa issued the Ningen-sengen, in which he quoted the Five Charter Oath of Emperor Meiji and declared that he was not an akitsumikami (a deity in human form).\\n\\n\\n=== Post-war ===\\n\\nDuring the U.S. occupation, a new Japanese constitution was drawn up. This enshrined freedom of religion and separated religion from the state, a measure designed to eradicate State Shinto. As part of this, the emperor formally declared that he was not a kami; any Shinto rituals performed by the imperial family became their own private affair. This disestablishment ended government subsidies to shrines and gave them renewed freedom to organise their own affairs. In 1946 many shrines formed a voluntary organisation, the Association of Shinto Shrines (Jinja Honchō). In 1956 the association issued a creedal statement, the keishin seikatsu no kōryō (\"general characteristics of a life lived in reverence of the kami\"), to summarise what they regarded as Shinto\\'s principles. By the late 1990s around 80% of Japan\\'s Shinto shrines were part of this association.In the post-war decades, many Japanese blamed Shinto for encouraging the militarism which had led to defeat and occupation. Others remained nostalgic for State Shinto, and concerns were repeatedly expressed that sectors of Japanese society were conspiring to restore it. Various legal debates revolved around the involvement of public officials in Shinto. In 1965, for instance, the city of Tsu, Mie Prefecture paid four Shinto priests to purify the site where the municipal athletic hall was to be built. Critics brought the case to court, claiming it contravened the constitutional separation of religion and state; in 1971 the high court ruled that the city administration\\'s act had been unconstitutional, although this was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1977.During the post-war period, Shinto themes often blended into Japanese new religious movements; of the Sect Shinto groups, Tenrikyo was probably the most successful in the post-war decades, although in 1970 it repudiated its Shinto identity. Shinto perspectives also influenced Japanese popular culture. The film director Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli for instance acknowledged Shinto influences on his films such as Spirited Away. Shinto also spread abroad through both Japanese migrants and conversion by non-Japanese. The Tsubaki Grand Shrine in Suzuka, Mie Prefecture, was the first to establish a branch abroad: the Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America, initially located in California and then moved to Granite Falls, Washington.During the 20th century, most academic research on Shinto was conducted by Shinto theologians, often priests, bringing accusations that it often blurred theology with historical analysis. From the 1980s onward, there was a renewed academic interest in Shinto both in Japan and abroad.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nMost Japanese participate in several religious traditions, with Breen and Teeuwen noting that, \"with few exceptions\", it is not possible to differentiate between Shintoists and Buddhists in Japan. The main exceptions are members of minority religious groups, including Christianity, which promote exclusivist worldviews. Determining the proportions of the country\\'s population who engage in Shinto activity is hindered by the fact that, if asked, Japanese people will often say \"I have no religion\". Many Japanese avoid the term \"religion\", in part because they dislike the connotations of the word which most closely matches it in the Japanese language, shūkyō. The latter term derives from shū (\"sect\") and kyō (\"doctrine\").Official statistics show Shinto to be Japan\\'s largest religion, with over 80 percent of the country\\'s population identified as engaging in Shinto activities. Conversely, in questionnaires only a small minority of Japanese describe themselves as \"Shintoists.\" This indicates that a far larger number of people engage in Shinto activities than cite Shinto as their religious identity. There are no formal rituals to become a practitioner of \"folk Shinto\". Thus, \"Shinto membership\" is often estimated counting only those who do join organised Shinto sects. Shinto has about 81,000 shrines and about 85,000 priests in the country. According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008, less than 40% of the population of Japan identifies with an organised religion: around 35% are Buddhists, 30% to 40% are members of Shinto sects and derived religions. In 2008, 26% of the participants reported often visiting Shinto shrines, while only 16.2% expressed belief in the existence of kami in general.\\n\\n\\n=== Outside Japan ===\\n\\nShinto is primarily found in Japan, although the period of the empire it was introduced to various Japanese colonies and in the present is also practiced by members of the Japanese diaspora.\\nJinja outside Japan are termed kaigai jinja (\"overseas shrines\"), a term coined by Ogasawara Shōzō. These were established both in territories conquered by the Japanese and in areas where Japanese migrants settled. When the Japanese Empire collapsed in the 1940s, there were over 600 public shrines, and over 1,000 smaller shrines, within Japan\\'s conquered territories. Many of these were then disbanded. Shinto has attracted interest outside of Japan, in part because it lacks the doctrinal focus of major religions found in other parts of the world.\\nShinto was introduced to United States largely by interested European Americans rather than by Japanese migrants. Japanese migrants established several shrines in Brazil.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nShinto at Curlie\\nJinja Honcho – English – The Official Japanese Organization of 80,000 Shinto Shrines\\nKokugakuin University Encyclopedia of Shinto and its Japanese Shinto Jinja Database\\nTsubaki Grand Shrine of America – Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America: Jinja Shinto in North America, branch of Tsubaki Grand Shrine in Mie Japan\\nHeian Jingu Shrine – Heian Shrine in Kyoto City was built in 1895 in commemoration of the 1100th anniversary of the move of Japanese Capital from Nara to Kyoto in 794\\nMeiji Jingu – Meiji Jingu Shrine in Yoyogi, Tokyo, commemorates Emperor Taisho and his wife Empress Shoken\\nYasukuni Jinja – A shrine for the honoring of Japanese War Dead (English)\\nShoin-Jinja – Shoin Shrine in Tokyo enshrines Yoshida Shoin, a spiritual leader of Meiji Restoration\\nYushima Tenjin – A Tokyo Shrine with and English site—Shrine for Ameno-tajikaraono-mikoto and Sugawara Michizane\\n'], ['Smi+Öice', 'City', 'Smiřice (Czech pronunciation: [ˈsmɪr̝ɪtsɛ]; German: Smirschitz) is a town in Hradec Králové District in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic.

Her second space mission consisted of a 6 month mission to the International Space Station.After a successful liftoff on April 2, 2010 from the Baikonur spaceport on board the Soyuz TMA-18 as Board Engineer 2 with Soyuz Commander Aleksandr Skvortsov and Board Engineer 1 Mikhail Korniyenko and following a two-day rendezvous and docking maneuver with the ISS, she joined Expedition 23 as a Flight Engineer and transferred on June 2, 2010 to Expedition 24 again as a Flight Engineer after the departure of the Soyuz TMA-17\\n\\nDuring the first half of her flight, Caldwell-Dyson and the Expedition 23 crew were joined by the STS-131 crew from April 7 to April 17. This period was the first and only time that four women were together on board the same spacecraft: Caldwell-Dyson, NASA astronauts Stephanie Wilson and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger, and JAXA astronaut Naoko Yamazaki.\\nFrom May 16 to May 23, the second and last Space Shuttle visiting mission for Caldwell-Dyson's flight, STS-132, joined the Expedition 23 crew for the installation of the Russian built module : Rassvet.The second half of Caldwell-Dyson's mission was marked by the failure of a coolant pump at the beginning of August. Caldwell Dyson performed her first spacewalk on August 7, 2010 with NASA astronaut Douglas Wheelock. The task for this first of three contingency EVA was to prepare the malfunctioning coolant pump for replacement on the next spacewalks that took place on August 11, 2010 and August 16, 2010. She performed all of this contingency EVA.After 176 days, 1 hour, 18 minutes and 38 seconds in space, Caldwell-Dyson landed in Kazakhstan on September 25, 2010. During this spaceflight, she completed three spacewalks, logging 22 hrs and 49 minutes of Extra-vehicular activity work to replace a malfunctioning coolant pump.\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\n\\nCaldwell Dyson is a private pilot and conversational in American Sign Language (ASL) and Russian. She is also the lead vocalist for the all-astronaut band Max Q.In 2011, Caldwell Dyson served as the guest judge on a space-themed episode of the Food Network show Cupcake Wars. She appeared on Episode 3 of MasterChef Junior Season 4.Caldwell Dyson also advised Jessica Chastain when the actress was preparing to appear as an astronaut and mission commander in the 2015 movie The Martian. Chastain said she was very inspired by Caldwell Dyson.Caldwell Dyson belongs to the Sigma Xi Research Society and the American Chemical Society.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\nHonorary Doctorate, California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) (May 2008)\\nNASA Performance Award (2002 & 2001)\\nNASA Go the Extra Mile (GEM) Award (2001)\\nNASA Superior Accomplishment Award (2000)\\nNASA Group Achievement Award – Russian Crusader Team (2000)\\nCamille and Henry Dreyfus Postdoctoral Fellowship in Environmental Science (1997)\\nOutstanding Doctoral Student Award in Chemistry from the University of California, Davis (1997)\\nAmerican Vacuum Society – HWhetten Award (1996)\\nAmerican Vacuum Society Graduate Research Award (1996)\\nPro Femina Research Consortium Graduate Research Award (1996)\\nPro Femina Research Consortium Graduate Award for Scientific Travel (1996)\\nUniversity of California, Davis Graduate Research Award (1996)\\nUniversity of California, Davis Graduate Student Award for Scientific Travel (1994)\\nPatricia Roberts Harris Graduate Fellowship in Chemistry (1993–1997)\\nLyle Wallace Award for Service to the Department of Chemistry, California State University Fullerton (1993)\\nNational Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates Award (1992)\\nCouncil of Building & Construction Trades Scholarship (1991 and 1992)\\nBig West Scholar Athlete (1989–1991)\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n Biography portal\\n Spaceflight portal\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial NASA Bio\\nSpacefacts biography of Tracy Caldwell Dyson\\n\"], ['Ulrich_Walter', 'Astronauts', 'Ulrich Hans Walter (born February 9, 1954) is a German physicist, engineer and a former DFVLR astronaut.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nWalter was born in Iserlohn.

The character appeared in the award-winning series Runaways. Like the original Runaways, Victor has a supervillain for a parent; his is the classic Avengers villain Ultron, an evil robot bent on world domination. Victor, however, is a cyborg, with human flesh and natural tissue cloned from his human mother which completely conceals his metal parts and circuitry.\\n\\n\\n== Publication history ==\\nVictor Mancha was created by author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona and debuted in Runaways vol. 2 #1 (April 2005).\\n\\n\\n== Fictional character biography ==\\nWhen Ultron encountered a woman named Marianella Mancha who is unable to have a child due to a drug that was put in her, Ultron took some of her DNA and cloned it while combining some of his advanced nano-technology to create for her a son named Victor Mancha.\\nThe Runaways first heard of Victor Mancha as a boy who would grow up to become the villain \"Victorious\", a man who would rule the world after dismantling the Avengers. Due to his prophesied betrayal, Victor was kept under close surveillance when he first joined the team, but has since been accepted as a full-fledged member. He is the team\\'s only Latino member and one of two members who can pilot the Leapfrog, the Runaways\\' mode of transportation.\\n\\n\\n=== True Believers ===\\nVictor is first introduced as the son of Mexican single mother Marianella Mancha, supposed widow of a United States Marine Corps member who was killed in action.When an older version of Gertrude Yorkes arrives in the present, she informs the Runaways of a villain in her time named \"Victorious\", and how they must stop him right now while he is still a teen. It is at this point she dies, but the Runaways decide to comply with her wish. After the Runaways track Victor down at his school, the sight of Karolina Dean activates Victor\\'s electromagnetic superpowers - it would later be revealed that Victor\\'s powers would manifest only when he came in contact with another superhero, hence Karolina.Remembering how future-Gert mentioned that Victorious\\'s father was the \"greatest evil in all the universe\", the Runaways sift through possibilities such as Magneto, Electro, Kingpin, Red Skull, Leader, and Galactus. Although Doctor Doom calls Victor proclaiming he is his father, it turns out that it is merely a Doombot created by Ultron. Victor discovers that his actual \"father\" is Ultron who created Victor as a sleeper agent for the Avengers. Victor was meant to grow up, travel to New York and meet the Avengers. After years of loyal service, he would have access to their most guarded secrets, and then Ultron would have taken over and destroyed every hero on the planet. The Runaways foiled this plan, but Victor still fears this future may come true. Ultron kills Marianella and overrides Victor\\'s circuits, forcing him to attack the Runaways. With help from Excelsior, the Runaways and Victor defeat Ultron, but they take Victor in after realizing that Victor is in the same boat as they are.\\n\\n\\n=== Runaways ===\\nOver the next few months, Victor proves himself to the team, particularly to Chase Stein, in battle to make up for his alternate future self. He falls out of grace for a short while after Nico Minoru discovers that the second Pride has tapped into Victor\\'s circuits and was using him to spy on the team.\\nAfter the Runaways\\' fight with the new \\nPride, Victor begins a physical relationship with Nico; he confesses to have initiated it because he harbors romantic feelings for her, but Nico claims to have participated as a way to escape her survivor\\'s guilt regarding the death of Gertrude Yorkes. However, Victor still attempts a rescue when he discovers Chase has Nico hostage, but is easily shut down when Chase asks him a rhetorical question designed to overload Victor\\'s circuits. Victor recovers with help from Molly Hayes (vicariously by Alex Wilder) and saves Nico from becoming an innocent sacrifice to the Gibborim. At this point, Victor and Nico begin a romantic relationship, but their moment of bliss is interrupted when the team is forced to run from Iron Man and the pro-registration forces of Marvel\\'s Civil War.\\n\\n\\n=== Civil War ===\\nDuring a S.H.I.E.L.D. operation to capture the Runaways, Victor uses his powers to shield the Leapfrog from a barrage of missiles. The second wave of missiles are coated with Teflon, so they are unaffected by Victor\\'s magnetic powers and hit him. He suffers grievous damage and the team returns with him to the Hostel. Victor then experiences intense seizures when the Vision arrives with the Young Avengers.Although the Runaways are initially mistrustful of the Young Avengers, Stature is able to pull the Vision away from Victor. The Vision explains that he and Victor were experiencing a form of feedback caused by their shared programming because both of them were created by Ultron.Nico and Victor also initiate a relationship.Victor\\'s assortment of humorous nicknames is a sort of running gag in the series\\' second volume, with such names as \"Static Cling Lad\", \"Mr. Roboto\", \"Victron\", \"Calculator Kid\", \"Señor Cyborg\", \"Man of La Mancha\", \"RoboPinocchio\", and Magnet Man.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Dead-End Kids ===\\nAfter escaping Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D., Nico makes a decision to make a deal with the Kingpin, which disgusts Victor. In a twisted turn of events, the Runaways end up time-displaced in 1907 New York. It is during this period where Victor meets Lillie \"the Spieler\" McGurty, a girl who can fly to the sound of music. While separated from Nico, Victor bonds with Lillie\\'s carefree spirit. A short time later, he has a dream of kissing Lillie. Nico, understanding her relationship with Victor is deteriorating, backs off and allows Victor to initiate a relationship with Lillie, who agrees to return to the present with the Runaways. Right before the Runaways board the time machine that takes them home, Lillie changes her mind and decides to stay instead, due to fear of jumping into the future. Klara Prast takes her place instead, arriving with the Runaways in the present. Although the Runaways do not know, Lillie is still alive, regretting her decision.The Runaways come under attack when a group of Majesdaneans arrive on Earth to capture Karolina. In the end, the team is overpowered, but Xavin shapeshifts into Karolina\\'s form and takes her place as a prisoner of the Majesdaneans.\\n\\n\\n=== Avengers A.I. ===\\nFollowing the Age of Ultron storyline, Victor Mancha joins up with Henry Pym\\'s Avengers A.I. alongside Monica Chang, Vision (his older \"brother\"), and a reprogrammed Doombot. During one mission he sacrifices himself to save a server containing an A.I. civilization. The team later discovers he is alive inside a server called The Diamond when he sends Morse code to Pym that says \"Fruit Loops\", a cereal he hates, which Pym interprets as he is still alive. Victor finds allies against the rogue A.I. He and the Avengers are saved when Monica Chang cuts off the virus by preventing the execution of a rogue LMD.\\n\\n\\n=== Vision ===\\nSome time later, Victor moves in with Vision after getting an internship in Washington, D.C. It is later revealed that Victor is actually acting as an undercover agent for the Avengers, with orders to spy on Vision and his family due to their increasingly erratic behavior. It is revealed via flashbacks that during his time with the Runaways, Victor had secretly developed an addiction to Vibranium, which for him acts similar to narcotics used by humans. After using the Vibranium in a special piano given to Vision by Black Panther, Victor misjudges the strength of his powers and accidentally kills Vision\\'s son, Vin. Captain America arrests him, but Vision defeats the Avengers to reach his cell. Vision is unable to kill Victor, but Victor\\'s cybernetic heart is ripped out of his body by Vision\\'s wife Virginia—killing him. With his final thoughts, he is at peace, knowing that he \"will never be Victorious.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Becoming Victorious ===\\nWhen Chase Stein attempts to revive Victor\\'s head, the \"Victorious\" program begins. It is revealed that Victor is conscious when Chase Stein, Nico Minoru, Gertrude Yorkes, and Old Lace visit Molly Hayes to see if she is interested in reforming the Runaways again. During this visit, Molly is the only one to figure out that he is conscious, and is happy that Victor is still alive in a sense. Victor asks Molly to keep this a secret as he figures out whether or not he wants to rejoin Chase and the others. But unknown to the Runaways, Molly\\'s grandmother plucks a strand of hair from Victor\\'s head with unclear intentions.\\n\\n\\n== Powers and abilities ==\\nVictor Mancha is a cyborg, created from the DNA of Marianella Mancha and the technology of Ultron. Victor was constructed using advanced nanite technology that will evolve and mature with Victor into adulthood so that his robotic innards will transform into artificial human organs, indistinguishable from real ones. Ultron created Victor with several computer-related abilities, including a high level of intelligence, vast amounts of hard drive memory (which Victor refers to as photographic memory), and the ability to communicate with other machines directly. Victor also possesses some level of superhuman strength, incredible speed, a powerful jumping ability, and an automated self-repair function.\\nIn combat, Victor primarily employs his electromagnetic abilities; he is capable of directing high voltage electrical energy from his hands and manipulating magnetic fields to reshape and bend metallic objects. Much like Magneto, Victor can use Earth\\'s natural magnetic lines of force to levitate and fly.\\nDespite his array of powers, Victor has four known weaknesses, many of which stem from his mechanical roots. At his current age, Victor\\'s nanites have not yet fully transformed into human organs, so his entire body will set off metal detectors, potentially drawing him unwanted attention. Second, Victor\\'s mainframe can be hacked and controlled remotely; \"Hunter\" (of the second Pride) (Victor removed it with an internal firewall) and Ultron are the only two that have successfully hacked Victor thus far. Victor discovered his third weakness during the Runaways\\' first encounter with the Young Avengers, when he and the Vision both short-circuited upon getting too close to each other. The Runaways and Young Avengers eventually discovered that when any two of Ultron\\'s creations come within a close vicinity, both create a devastating feedback, harming both machines. This weakness has apparently since been removed, as Victor has been shown interacting with the Vision\\'s new family without any harm to either.\\nWhile decoding The Abstract, Chase discovered Victor\\'s last and most potent weakness: three questions designed specifically to overload Victor\\'s circuits and lock him into a never ending loop of meaningless binary, which Nico refers to as \"the blue screen of death.\" Chase used the first phrase against Victor after the cyborg discovered Nico in chains: \"Could God make a sandwich so big that even He couldn\\'t finish it?\"  The only way for Victor to recover from his shutdown mode is by hearing the question\\'s answer from someone else. Once Victor\\'s mainframe becomes functional again, he cannot be affected by that specific phrase ever again. The two other phrases are unrevealed as yet, and are known only to Chase and Nico.\\n\\n\\n== Other versions ==\\n\\n\\n=== What If? ===\\nIn What If the Runaways became the Young Avengers?, Victor is first contacted by his future self of Victorious after Victorious traveled back from the future with Iron Lad, who accidentally landed in Victorious\\'s time while attempting to escape Kang the Conqueror. Victor and Victorious steal the Iron Lad armor and Victor pretends to be Iron Lad. He then recruits the Runaways forcing them to be an actual superhero team with costumes, but intends to kill them. When Kang appears to rescue his younger self, the subsequent fight results in Iron Lad being killed and Kang being erased from history while Victor destroys his future self rejecting his evil ways. Having averted his destiny, Victor then departs via Kang\\'s time-belt to find his own way, leaving the Runaways to continue as Young Avengers with Chase now using parts of the Iron Lad armor.\\n\\n\\n=== Age of Ultron ===\\nDuring the Age of Ultron storyline, Victor Mancha was bringing some children to one of the Runaways\\' old bases in Los Angeles. Victor is having a hard time because he believes that if he uses his machine abilities, he will just help Ultron’s victory. He does not tell any of his newfound friends about his background because he is afraid they will not accept him. In a flashback, it is shown that his Runaways teammates were all killed by Ultron and that Victor had stored digital versions of them in his memory banks, but these files seem to be corrupted since they seem to telling him that he needs to become more machine and less human. The Ultron Sentinels find the hideout and start killing some of the kids that Victor had saved. Victor decides to fight the Ultron Sentinels while determining that if this is the end, he will go down fighting.\\n\\n\\n=== Avengers A.I. ===\\nIn one alternate future, Alexis has a vision of 12,000 A.D. in which rogue A.I. Dimitrios wiped out humanity, the Kree, the Skrulls, and the Inhumans and traps all mutants in a pocket dimension. Only the Avengers A.I. survive, led by Alexis. Victor in this future wields Ultimate Thor\\'s hammer and joins the surviving Avengers in attacking Dimitrios, who created a spaceship out of Galactus\\'s carcass. He is killed by Dimitrios and Doombot then sacrifices himself, since Victor was the only person he considered a \"Pal\".\\n\\n\\n== In other media ==\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\nVictor Mancha / Victorious is mentioned as an antagonistic force in the years 2022 and 2028 in the third season of Runaways.Mancha was responsible for the deep scar that a future Chase Stein from 2028 received on his neck. In that alternate future, Mancha was also involved with Alex Wilder.\\n\\n\\n== Conceptual origins ==\\nOn colorist Christina Strain\\'s Live Journal, she revealed that Victor\\'s eyes are green with a golden center, which was modeled after Gael García Bernal.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n'], ['Vidnava', 'City', 'Vidnava (German: Weidenau, Polish: Widnawa) is a town in Jeseník District in the Olomouc Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 1,300 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n\\nThe town\\'s name is derived from the name of the Vidnávka River. The name of the river has its origin in vidět (i.e. \"to see\"), which was derived from the clear water through which it could be seen.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\nVidnava lies approximately 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of Jeseník, 87 km (54 mi) north of Olomouc, and 200 km (120 mi) east of Prague.\\nVidnava is located on the border with Poland. It lies in the Silesian Lowlands, on the right bank of the river Vidnávka.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe first written mention of Vidnava is from 1291. The town prospered until the Hussite Wars, during which it was conquered and burned. Vidnava did not recover until the early 16th century, when there was a boom in crafts. The town was again destroyed by a large fire in 1574, and then during the Thirty Years\\' War.The history of the town was influenced by the War of the Austrian Succession in 1741–1745. The newly established borders of Silesia made Vidnava a border town, cut off from the rich villages to the east of it.During the World War II, the German occupiers operated the E780 forced labour subcamp and the E214 subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in Vidnava. Four PoWs who were killed by the Germans during escape attempts were buried at the Catholic cemetery in Vidnava. For many prisoners of war, Vidnava was a stopping place on The March during the final months of the World War II in Europe. A memorial dedicated to 19 victims of The March is on local cemetery.\\n\\n\\n== Sights ==\\n\\nThe historic town centre is delimited by the preserved remains of the late medieval town fortifications from the 15th and the 16th centuries. The town square is lined by medieval houses with late Baroque and Empire gables.The landmark is the Church of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. It was originally a Gothic church, founded together with the town in the 13th century. Today\\'s appearance is the result of Baroque and Neoclassical reconstructions.

His family moved to Tashkent soon after his birth.\\nIn 1964 he married Liliya Munirovna Dzhanibekova, who was a descendant of Janibeg, medieval ruler of the Golden Horde. As her father had no sons, Dzhanibekov took his wife\\'s family name in order to honour her ancestry and continue her line of descent, an unusual step for a husband in the Soviet Union.In 1960 he entered Leningrad University to study physics, where he became involved in flying, something in which he had always been interested. In 1961 he decided to enroll in the V. M. Komarov Higher Military Flying School at Yeisk and simultaneously studied at the Taganrog State University of Radioengineering. Four years later he graduated and became a flying instructor in the Soviet Air Forces serving at military training unit number 99735 in Taganrog in 1968–1970. In 1970 during the visit of Gherman Titov to the Taganrog-based training unit, he was selected into the team of cosmonauts. This was the same year that he joined the Communist Party.\\nDzhanibekov made five flights: Soyuz 27, Soyuz 39, Soyuz T-6, Soyuz T-12, and Soyuz T-13. In all he had spent 145 days, 15 hours, and 56 minutes in space over these five missions. He had also performed two EVAs with a total time of 8 hours and 35 minutes. In 1985 he noted the effects of the tennis racket theorem, subsequently also called the Dzhanibekov effect, by showing that rotation about an object\\'s intermediate principal axis is unstable while in free fall.\\nAfter leaving the cosmonaut program in 1986, he became involved in politics. He was the Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of Uzbek SSR from 1985 until 1990. He is also interested in photography and painting and his works, predominantly about space, are owned by museums and private collectors.\\nVladimir Dzhanibekov attempted to circumnavigate the globe by balloon.  He partnered with Larry Newman who envisioned flying a NASA designed sky anchor balloon.  This unique hourglass shaped design used a zero pressure helium balloon for buoyancy and a superpressure balloon for variable ballast.  Manufactured by Raven Industries the double balloon system together measured 354 feet (108 m) tall.  From Tillamook, Oregon on 8 September 1990, a proof of concept flight was made by Dzhanibekov, Newman, Tim Lachenmeier, and Don Moses.  Moses replaced Richard Branson who was unable to make a weather window departure time.  Flying 31 hours thru two nights and landing at Omak, Washington proved the sky anchor balloon worked as manufactured. Dzhanibekov, Larry Newman, and Don Moses piloted the Earthwinds Hilton balloon which was primarily sponsored by Barron Hilton. In 1992 an attempt from Akron, Ohio did not launch due to strong winds.  The next attempt was a planned pre-dawn launch but was delayed for several hours by difficulties inflating both balloons.  Launching later than desired, on 13 January 1993 the Earthwinds liftoff from Reno Stead Airport flew for 30 minutes before crashing.  After liftoff the Earthwinds balloon could not penetrate a strong inversion layer and tore the ballast balloon on a mountain peak. The three crewmen survived the crash without injuries.  An additional flight on 31 December 1994 reached 29,000 feet (8,800 m) when the ballast balloon failed.  These sky anchor balloon failures influenced other circumnavigation attempts to use a Roziere balloon system.     The minor planet 3170 Dzhanibekov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979, is named after him.\\n\\n\\n== Honours and awards ==\\nTwice Hero of the Soviet Union (1978 and 1981)\\nPilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR\\nOrder of Friendship (Russian Federation)\\nFive Orders of Lenin\\nOrder of the Red Star\\nOrder \"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\" 3rd class\\nMedal \"For Merit in Space Exploration\" (Russian Federation)\\nJubilee Medal \"Twenty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\"\\nJubilee Medal \"50 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\\nJubilee Medal \"60 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\\nJubilee Medal \"50 Years of the Soviet Militia\"\\nMedals \"For Impeccable Service\" 1st, 2nd, and 3rd classes\\nKosmonavtlar metro station in Tashkent commemorates Uzbekistan\\'s contribution to the Soviet space programme including that of DzhanibekovForeign awards:\\n\\nHero of the Mongolian People\\'s Republic\\nCommander of the Legion of Honour (France)\\nOrder of the Banner of the Hungarian People\\'s Republic\\nOrder of Sukhbaatar (Mongolia)He is an honorary citizen of Gagarin; Kaluga (Russia); Arkalyk (Kazakhstan); Baikonur (Kazakhstan); and Houston (United States).\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nTennis racket theorem, or Dzhanibekov effect, a theorem in dynamics involving the stability of a rotating body with different moments of inertia along each axis.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nhttp://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?no=363760&rel_no=1\\nhttp://www.spacefacts.de/bios/cosmonauts/english/dzhanibekov_vladimir.htm\\nhttp://www.zarya.info/Diaries/StationsDOS/Salyut6Ex5.php\\nhttp://www.zarya.info/Diaries/StationsDOS/Salyut6Ex1.php\\nhttp://www.astronautix.com/d/dzhanibekov.html\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20031025104649/http://www.balloonlife.com/publications/balloon_life/9711/rtwretro9711.htm\\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sci.space.news/R8h4oDuW1BQ/AsL0_ERagbwJ\\nhttps://www.nap.edu/catalog/10531/leaving-earth-space-stations-rival-superpowers-and-the-quest-for\\n'], ['Votice', 'City', 'Votice (Czech pronunciation: [ˈvocɪtsɛ]; German: Wotitz) is a town in Benešov District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic.

His work ranges from realistic portraiture to comic strip-like series of pictures called \"modern moral subjects\", and he is perhaps best known for his series A Harlot\\'s Progress, A Rake\\'s Progress and Marriage A-la-Mode.  Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as \"Hogarthian\".Hogarth was born in London to a lower-middle-class family. In his youth he took up an apprenticeship with an engraver, but did not complete the apprenticeship. His father underwent periods of mixed fortune, and was at one time imprisoned in lieu of outstanding debts, an event that is thought to have informed William\\'s paintings and prints with a hard edge.Influenced by French and Italian painting and engraving, Hogarth\\'s works are mostly satirical caricatures, sometimes bawdily sexual, mostly of the first rank of realistic portraiture. They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation. Charles Lamb deemed Hogarth\\'s images to be books, filled with \"the teeming, fruitful, suggestive meaning of words. Other pictures we look at; his pictures we read.\"\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nWilliam Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth, a poor Latin school teacher and textbook writer, and Anne Gibbons. In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in Leicester Fields, where he learned to engrave trade cards and similar products.Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw.  Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking coffee house at St John\\'s Gate, was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison for five years. Hogarth never spoke of his father\\'s imprisonment.In 1720, Hogarth enrolled at the original St Martin\\'s Lane Academy in Peter Court, London, which was run by Louis Chéron and John Vanderbank. He attended alongside other future leading figures in art and design, such as Joseph Highmore, William Kent, and Arthur Pond. However, the academy seems to have stopped operating in 1724, at around the same time that Vanderbank fled to France in order to avoid creditors. Hogarth recalled of the first incarnation of the academy: \"this lasted a few years but the treasurer sinking the subscription money the lamp stove etc were seized for rent and the whole affair put a stop to.\" Hogarth then enrolled in another drawing school, in Covent Garden, shortly after it opened in November 1724, which was run by Sir James Thornhill, serjeant painter to the king. On Thornhill, Hogarth later claimed that, even as an apprentice, \"the painting of St Pauls and gree[n]wich hospital … were during this time runing in my head\", referring to the massive schemes of decoration painted by Thornhill for the dome of St Paul\\'s Cathedral, and Greenwich Hospital.Hogarth became a member of the Rose and Crown Club, with Peter Tillemans, George Vertue, Michael Dahl, and other artists and connoisseurs.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nBy April 1720, Hogarth was an engraver in his own right, at first engraving coats of arms and shop bills and designing plates for booksellers.\\nIn 1727, he was hired by Joshua Morris, a tapestry worker, to prepare a design for the Element of Earth. Morris heard that he was \"an engraver, and no painter\", and consequently declined the work when completed. Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the Westminster Court, where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728.\\n\\n\\n=== Early works ===\\n\\nEarly satirical works included an Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme (c.1721, published 1724), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720, known as the South Sea Bubble, in which many English people lost a great deal of money. In the bottom left corner, he shows Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Jewish figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is \"Who\\'l Ride\". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the South Sea Company, which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.Other early works include The Lottery (1724); The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons (1724);  A Just View of the British Stage (1724); some book illustrations; and the small print Masquerades and Operas (1724). The latter is a satire on contemporary follies, such as the masquerades of the Swiss impresario John James Heidegger, the popular Italian opera singers, John Rich\\'s pantomimes at Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, and the exaggerated popularity of Lord Burlington\\'s protégé, the architect and painter William Kent. He continued that theme in 1727, with the Large Masquerade Ticket. In 1726, Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings illustrating Samuel Butler\\'s Hudibras.\\n\\n These he himself valued highly, and they are among his best book illustrations.\\nIn the following years, he turned his attention to the production of small \"conversation pieces\" (i.e., groups in oil of full-length portraits from 12 to 15 inches (300 to 380 mm) high. Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were The Fountaine Family (c.1730), The Assembly at Wanstead House, The House of Commons examining Bambridge, and several pictures of the chief actors in John Gay\\'s popular The Beggar\\'s Opera. One of his real-life subjects was Sarah Malcolm, whom he sketched two days before her execution.One of Hogarth\\'s masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of John Dryden\\'s The Indian Emperour, or The Conquest of Mexico by Spaniards, being the Sequel of The Indian Queen (1732–1735) at the home of John Conduitt, master of the mint, in St George\\'s Street, Hanover Square.Hogarth\\'s other works in the 1730s include A Midnight Modern Conversation (1733), Southwark Fair (1733), The Sleeping Congregation (1736), Before and After (1736), Scholars at a Lecture (1736), The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks) (1736), The Distrest Poet (1736), The Four Times of the Day (1738), and Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn (1738). He might also have printed Burlington Gate (1731), evoked by Alexander Pope\\'s Epistle to Lord Burlington, and defending Lord Chandos, who is therein satirized. This print gave great offence, and was suppressed. However, modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth.\\n\\n\\n=== Moralizing art ===\\n\\n\\n==== Harlot\\'s Progress and Rake\\'s Progress ====\\n\\nIn 1731, Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to wide recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled A Harlot\\'s Progress and appeared first as paintings (now lost) before being published as engravings. A Harlot\\'s Progress depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting – the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character\\'s death from venereal disease.The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733–1735 by the sequel A Rake\\'s Progress. The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling – the character\\'s life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital. The original paintings of A Harlot\\'s Progress were destroyed in the fire at Fonthill House in 1755; the oil paintings of A Rake\\'s Progress (1733–34) are displayed in the gallery room at Sir John Soane\\'s Museum, London, UK.When the success of A Harlot\\'s Progress and A Rake\\'s Progress resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists\\' work. The result was the Engravers\\' Copyright Act (known as \\'Hogarth\\'s Act\\'), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognise the authorial rights of an individual artist.\\n\\n\\n==== Marriage A-la-Mode ====\\n\\nIn 1743–1745, Hogarth painted the six pictures of Marriage A-la-Mode (National Gallery, London), a pointed skewering of upper-class 18th-century society. This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials.\\nMarital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain. The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism, with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage. Hogarth here painted a satire – a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey – of a conventional marriage within the English upper class. All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form. The series, which is set in a Classical interior, shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield, the son of bankrupt Earl Squander, to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant, starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl\\'s grand house and ending with the murder of the son by his wife\\'s lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at Tyburn for murdering her husband.\\n\\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray wrote: This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl ... The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counsellor, who kills him, and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue\\'s dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London), where the counsellor has been \\'executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral: don\\'t listen to evil silver-tongued counsellors; don\\'t marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money; don\\'t frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband; don\\'t have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn.\\n\\n\\n==== Industry and Idleness ====\\n\\nIn the twelve prints of Industry and Idleness (1747), Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, while the other, who is idle, commits crime and is eventually executed. This shows the work ethic of Protestant England, where those who worked hard were rewarded, such as the industrious apprentice who becomes Sheriff (plate 8), Alderman (plate 10), and finally the Lord Mayor of London in the last plate in the series. The idle apprentice, who begins \"at play in the church yard\" (plate 3), holes up \"in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute\" after turning highwayman (plate 7) and \"executed at Tyburn\" (plate 11). The idle apprentice is sent to the gallows by the industrious apprentice himself. For each plate, there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom, mostly from the Book of Proverbs, such as for the first plate:\\n\\n\"Industry and Idleness, shown here, \\'Proverbs Ch:10 Ver:4 The hand of the diligent maketh rich.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n==== Beer Street and Gin Lane ====\\n\\nLater prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in Beer Street and Gin Lane (1751). Hogarth engraved Beer Street to show a happy city drinking the \\'good\\' beverage, English beer, in contrast to Gin Lane, in which the effects of drinking gin are shown – as a more potent liquor, gin caused more problems for society. There had been a sharp increase in the popularity of gin at this time, which was called the \\'Gin Craze.\\' It started in the early 18th century, after a series of legislative actions in the late 17th century impacted the importation and manufacturing of alcohol in London. Among these, were the Prohibition of 1678, which barred popular French brandy imports, and the forced disbandment, in 1690, of the London Guild of Distillers, whose members had previously been the only legal manufacturers of alcohol, leading to an increase in the production and then  consumption of domestic gin.In Beer Street, people are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous, while in Gin Lane, they are scrawny, lazy and careless. The woman at the front of Gin Lane, who lets her baby fall to its death, echoes the tale of Judith Dufour, who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money. The prints were published in support of the Gin Act 1751.\\nHogarth\\'s friend, the magistrate Henry Fielding, may have enlisted Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act; Beer Street and Gin Lane were issued shortly after his work An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers, and Related Writings, and addressed the same issues.\\n\\n\\n==== The Four Stages of Cruelty ====\\n\\nOther prints were his outcry against inhumanity in The Four Stages of Cruelty (published 21 February 1751), in which Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals which he saw around him and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner. In the first print, there are scenes of boys torturing dogs, cats and other animals. It centers around a poorly dressed boy committing a  violent act of torture upon a dog, while being pleaded with to stop, and offered food, by another well-dressed boy. A boy behind them has graffitied a hanged stickman figure upon a wall, with the name \"Tom Nero\" underneath, and is pointing to this dog torturer.\\n\\nThe second shows Tom Nero has grown up to become a Hackney coach driver. His coach has overturned with a heavy load and his horse is lying on the ground, having broken its leg. He is beating it with the handle of his whip; its eye severely wounded. Other people around him are seen abusing their work animals and livestock, and a child is being run over by the wheel of a dray, as the drayman dozes off on the job.\\nIn the third print, Tom is shown to be a murderer, surrounded by a mob of accusers. The woman he has apparently killed is lying on the ground, brutally slain, with a trunk and sack of stolen goods near by. One of the accusers holds a letter from the woman to Tom, speaking of how wronging her mistress upsets her conscience, but that she is resolved to do as he would have her, closing with: \"I remain yours till death.\"\\nThe fourth, titled The Reward of Cruelty, shows Tom\\'s withering corpse being publicly dissected by scientists after his execution by hanging; a noose still around his neck. The dissection reflects the Murder Act 1751, which allowed for the public dissection of criminals who had been hanged for murder.\\n\\n\\n=== Portraits ===\\n\\nHogarth was also popular portrait painter. In 1745, he painted actor David Garrick as Richard III, for which he was paid £200, \"which was more\", he wrote, \"than any English artist ever received for a single portrait.\" In 1746, a sketch of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill, had an exceptional success.\\n\\nIn 1740, he created a truthful, vivid full-length portrait of his friend, the philanthropic Captain Coram, for the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, now in the Foundling Museum.  This portrait, and his unfinished oil sketch of a young fishwoman, entitled The Shrimp Girl (National Gallery, London), may be called masterpieces of British painting. There are also portraits of his wife, his two sisters, and of many other people; among them Bishop Hoadly and Bishop Herring.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical subjects ===\\nFor a long period, during the mid-18th century, Hogarth tried to achieve the status of a history painter, but did not earn much respect in this field. The painter, and later founder of the Royal Academy of Arts, Joshua Reynolds, was highly critical of Hogarth\\'s style and work. According to art historian David Bindman, in Dr Johnson\\'s serial of essays for London\\'s Universal Chronicle, The Idler, the three essays written by Reynolds for the months of September through November 1759 are directed at Hogarth. In them, Reynolds argues that this \"connoisseur\" has a \"servile attention to minute exactness\" and questions their idea of the imitation of nature as \"the obvious sense, that objects are represented naturally when they have such relief that they seem real.\" Reynolds rejected \"this kind of imitation\", favouring the \"grand style of painting\" which avoids \"minute attention\" to the visible world. In Reynolds\\' Discourse XIV, he grants Hogarth has \"extraordinary talents\", but reproaches him for \"very imprudently, or rather presumptuously, attempt[ing] the great historical style.\"Writer, art historian and politician, Horace Walpole, was also critical of Hogarth as a history painter, but did find value in his satirical prints.\\n\\n\\n==== Biblical scenes ====\\nHogarth\\'s history pictures include The Pool of Bethesda and The Good Samaritan, executed in 1736–1737 for St Bartholomew\\'s Hospital; Moses brought before Pharaoh\\'s Daughter, painted for the Foundling Hospital (1747, formerly at the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, now in the Foundling Museum); Paul before Felix (1748) at Lincoln\\'s Inn; and his altarpiece for St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol (1755–56).\\n\\n\\n==== The Gate of Calais ====\\nThe Gate of Calais (1748; now in Tate Britain) was produced soon after his return from a visit to France. Horace Walpole wrote that Hogarth had run a great risk to go there since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle: he went to France, and was so imprudent as to be taking a sketch of the drawbridge at Calais. He was seized and carried to the governor, where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several caricatures of the French; particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the Lion d\\'argent, the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it. They were much diverted with his drawings, and dismissed him.\\nBack home, he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies, the Frenchmen, as cringing, emaciated and superstitious people, while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives, destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority. He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate, with a \"soldier\\'s hand upon my shoulder\", running him in.\\n\\n\\n=== Other later works ===\\n\\nNotable Hogarth engravings in the 1740s include The Enraged Musician (1741), the six prints of Marriage à-la-mode (1745; executed by French artists under Hogarth\\'s inspection), and The Stage Coach or The Country Inn Yard (1747).In 1745, Hogarth painted a self-portrait with his pug dog, Trump (now also in Tate Britain), which shows him as a learned artist supported by volumes of Shakespeare, Milton and Swift. In 1749, he represented the somewhat disorderly English troops on their March of the Guards to Finchley (formerly located in Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, now Foundling Museum).Others works included his ingenious Satire on False Perspective (1754); his satire on canvassing in his Election series (1755–1758; now in Sir John Soane\\'s Museum); his ridicule of the English passion for cockfighting in The Cockpit (1759); his attack on Methodism in Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism (1762); his political anti-war satire in The Times, plate I (1762); and his pessimistic view of all things in Tailpiece, or The Bathos (1764).In 1757, Hogarth was appointed Serjeant Painter to the King.\\n\\n\\n=== Writing ===\\n\\nHogarth wrote and published his ideas of artistic design in his book The Analysis of Beauty (1753). In it, he professes to define the principles of beauty and grace which he, a real child of Rococo, saw realized in serpentine lines (the Line of Beauty). By some of Hogarth\\'s adherents, the book was praised as a fine deliverance upon aesthetics; by his enemies and rivals, its obscurities and minor errors were made the subject of endless ridicule and caricature.\\n\\n\\n=== Painter and engraver of modern moral subjects ===\\nHogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized, being viewed in shop windows, taverns, and public buildings, and sold in printshops. Old hierarchies broke down, and new forms began to flourish: the ballad opera, the bourgeois tragedy, and especially, a new form of fiction called the novel with which authors such as Henry Fielding had great success. Therefore, by that time, Hogarth hit on a new idea: \"painting and engraving modern moral subjects ... to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer; my picture was my stage\", as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes.\\nHe drew from the highly moralizing Protestant tradition of Dutch genre painting, and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English broadsheet and other types of popular print. In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth. His prints were expensive, and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience.\\n\\n\\n=== Parodic borrowings from Old Masters ===\\nWhen analysing the work of the artist as a whole, Ronald Paulson says, \"In A Harlot\\'s Progress, every single plate but one is based on Dürer\\'s images of the story of the Virgin and the story of the Passion.\" In other works, he parodies Leonardo da Vinci\\'s Last Supper. According to Paulson, Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent God who intervenes in the lives of people and produces miracles. Indeed, Hogarth was a Deist, a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations. Thus, as a \"comic history painter\", he often poked fun at the old-fashioned, \"beaten\" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints. Hogarth also rejected Lord Shaftesbury\\'s then-current ideal of the classical Greek male in favour of the living, breathing female. He said, \"Who but a bigot, even to the antiques, will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian Venus doth but coarsely imitate.\"\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\nOn 23 March 1729, Hogarth eloped with Jane Thornhill at Paddington Church, against the wishes of her father, the artist Sir James Thornhill.\\n\\nSir James saw the match as unequal, as Hogarth was a rather obscure artist at the time. However, when Hogarth started on his series of moral prints, A Harlot\\'s Progress, some of the initial paintings were placed either in Sir James\\' drawing room or dining room, through the conspiring of Jane and her mother, in the hopes of reconciling him with the couple. When he saw them, he inquired as to the artist\\'s name and, upon hearing it, replied: \"Very well; the man who can produce such representations as these, can also maintain a wife without a portion.\" However, he soon after relented, becoming more generous to, and living in harmony with the couple until his death.Hogarth was initiated as a Freemason before 1728 in the Lodge at the Hand and Apple Tree Tavern, Little Queen Street, and later belonged to the Carrier Stone Lodge and the Grand Stewards\\' Lodge; the latter still possesses the \\'Hogarth Jewel\\' which Hogarth designed for the Lodge\\'s Master to wear. Today the original is in storage and a replica is worn by the Master of the Lodge. Freemasonry was a theme in some of Hogarth\\'s work, most notably \\'Night\\', the fourth in the quartet of paintings (later released as engravings) collectively entitled the Four Times of the Day.\\n\\nHis main home was in Leicester Square (then known as Leicester Fields), but he bought a country retreat in Chiswick in 1749, the house now known as Hogarth\\'s House and preserved as a museum, and spent time there for the rest of his life.\\nThe Hogarths had no children, although they fostered foundling children. He was a founding Governor of the Foundling Hospital.\\nAmong his friends and acquaintances were many English artists and satirists of the period, such as Francis Hayman, Henry Fielding, and Laurence Sterne.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nOn 25 October 1764, Hogarth was conveyed from his villa in Chiswick to his home in Leicester Fields, in weak condition. He had been in a weakened state for a while by this time, but was said to be in a cheerful mood and was even still working—with some help; doing more retouches on The Bench on this same day. On 26 October, he received a letter from Benjamin Franklin and wrote up a rough draught in reply. Before going to bed that evening, he\\'d boasted about eating a pound of beefsteaks for dinner and reportedly looked more robust than he had in a while at this time. However, when he went to bed, he suddenly began vomiting; something that caused him to ring his bell so forcefully that it broke. Hogarth passed away around two hours later, in the arms of his servant, Mrs Mary Lewis. John Nichols claimed that he died of an aneurysm, which he said took place in the \"chest.\" Horace Walpole claimed that he died of \"a dropsy of his breast.\"Mrs Lewis, who stayed on with Jane Hogarth in Leicester Fields, was the only non-familial person acknowledged financially in Hogarth\\'s will and was left £100 (approximately £18,651.61 in 2020) for her \"faithful services.\"\\n\\nHogarth was buried at St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick, now in the west of London. His friend, actor David Garrick, composed the following inscription for his tombstone:\\n\\n\\n== Influence and reputation ==\\nHogarth\\'s works were a direct influence on John Collier, who was known as the \"Lancashire Hogarth\". The spread of Hogarth\\'s prints throughout Europe, together with the depiction of popular scenes from his prints in faked Hogarth prints, influenced Continental book illustration through the 18th and early 19th centuries, especially in Germany and France. He also influenced many caricaturists of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Hogarth\\'s influence lives on today as artists continue to draw inspiration from his work.\\nHogarth\\'s paintings and prints have provided the subject matter for several other works. For example, Gavin Gordon\\'s 1935 ballet The Rake\\'s Progress, to choreography by Ninette de Valois, was based directly on Hogarth\\'s series of paintings of that title. Igor Stravinsky\\'s 1951 opera The Rake\\'s Progress, with libretto by W. H. Auden, was less literally inspired by the same series. Hogarth\\'s engravings also inspired the BBC radio play The Midnight House by Jonathan Hall, based on the M. R. James ghost story \"The Mezzotint\" and first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2006.\\nRussell Banks\\' short story \"Indisposed\" is a fictional account of Hogarth\\'s infidelity as told from the viewpoint of his wife, Jane. Hogarth was the lead character in Nick Dear\\'s play The Art of Success, whilst he is played by Toby Jones in the 2006 television film A Harlot\\'s Progress.\\nHogarth\\'s House in Chiswick, west London, is now a museum; the major road junction next to it is named the Hogarth Roundabout. In 2014 both Hogarth\\'s House and the Foundling Museum held special exhibitions to mark the 250th anniversary of his death.\\nIn 2019, Sir John Soane\\'s Museum, which owns both The Rake\\'s Progress and The Humours of an Election, held an exhibition which assembled all Hogarth\\'s series of paintings, and his series of engravings, in one place for the first time.Stanley Kubrick based the cinematography of his 1975 period drama film, Barry Lyndon, on several Hogarth paintings.\\nIn Roger Michell\\'s 2003 film The Mother, starring Anne Reid and Daniel Craig, the protagonists visit Hogarth\\'s tomb during their first outing together.  They read aloud the poem inscribed there and their shared admiration of Hogarth helps to affirm their connection with one another.\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\n \\nPaintingsWilliam Hogarth\\'s paintings\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nEngravings\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nEnglish art\\nList of works by William Hogarth\\nJudy Egerton, Hogarth curator, cataloguer, and commentator\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nWilliam Hogarth, John Bowyer Nichols,  ed.

He competed in the 1968 and 1972 Olympics and won a bronze and a gold medal, respectively, clearing 5.50 m in 1972.\\n\\n\\n== Athletic career ==\\n\\nNordwig won a bronze in the pole vault at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. He was a member of the East German team, the first time East and West Germany had sent separate teams to the Olympics. In the contest, Nordwig, the American Bob Seagren and the West-German Claus Schiprowski all cleared at 5.40 m, Seagren and Schiprowski on their second attempts and Nordwig on his third. All missed at 5.45 m. Seagren was the gold medal winner because he had had fewer misses at lower heights than Schiprowski.Nordwig was Olympic champion at the pole vault at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Nordwig's keenest rivals for the title the Americans Bob Seagren, Steve Smith and Jan Johnson and the Swede Kjell Isaksson were amongst those vaulters banned by the world governing body the IAAF from competing with the lighter poles they had been using all season. An initial ban in July had been reversed on 27 August, but on the eve of the competition, 30 August, the IAAF reimposed their ban claiming the poles were new equipment and therefore invalid. Seagren, the defending champion, finished second; Johnson third; and Smith and Isaksson did not even qualify for the final. Nordwig had never preferred the new pole so was unaffected.In the competition itself, Johnson was eliminated at 5.40 m with Nordwig clearing on his second attempt and Seagren on his third. Nordwig then cleared 5.45 m with Seagren unable to match him. Nordwig then underlined his triumph by clearing 5.50 m for a new Olympic record and his personal best.Nordwig won five European titles: three outdoors (1966, 1969 and 1971) and two indoors (1971 and 1972). Domestically he won the East German title outdoors in 1965-72 and indoors in 1964-66, and 1969-72. During his career he set two world records. The first occasion was on 17 June 1970 in Berlin, Germany when he cleared 5.45 m (17 ft 10.6 in). The second was on 3 September 1970 in Turin, Italy, when he broke his own world record with a jump of 5.46 m (17 ft 11.0 in). In 1972 he became East German Sportsman of the Year and retired from competitions.\\n\\n\\n=== World rankings ===\\nNordwig was voted by the experts at Track and Field News to be ranked among the best in the world (the best in 1970 and 1971) in the pole vault in the period from 1965 to 1972.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nNordwig had a degree in physics and defended a PhD in economics. He worked for VEB Carl Zeiss Jena eventually becoming a director of research and development. Later, he was managing director of a travel company in Berlin. His brothers Reinhard and Hans-Jürgen competed nationally in middle-distance running.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6pRZCvAPlc The Highest – Arthur Penn\\n\"]]\n"
